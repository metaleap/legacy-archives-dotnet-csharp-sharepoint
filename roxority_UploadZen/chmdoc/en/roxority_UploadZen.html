<h1>Introduction</h1><h3>
	Why Use UploadZen for SharePoint Bulk-File Uploads?<b style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;" name="s0"></b></h3>
<p>
	UploadZen provides a much more sophisticated upload experience for your SharePoint
	document management efforts than the rather &quot;lightweight&quot; out-of-box upload
	tools do.</p>
<ul>
	<li>The SharePoint 2010 multi-upload function is based exclusively on the proprietary
		<i>Microsoft Silverlight</i> plugin, restricting the feature to a small sub-set
		of real-world users. UploadZen supports both <i>Flash and Silverlight</i>, <b>supporting
			a much higher percentage (90+%)</b> of your web site visitors and end users.</li>
	<li>Just like the out-of-box uploader, administrators can simply allow uploading of
		any and all file types and sizes into any Library. Unlike the built-in uploader,
		UploadZen lets them also <b>set up fine-grained rules prescribing exactly</b> which
		<b style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;" href="itemref_UploadActions.html">file types (ie. filter by allowing images-only,
			documents-only etc.) and/or sizes are allowed into which types of Libraries</b>.</li>
	<li>UploadZen provides <i>Chunking</i> for uploading files of <b>any size, including
		GB-sized files</b>, regardless of your server-side request length or file size limits.</li>
	<li>UploadZen allows for client-side <b>on-the-fly image resizing</b> prior to the upload,
		resulting in much faster upload times and substantial bandwidth savings.</li>
	<li>UploadZen conveniently <b>alerts end users about existing files with the same name</b>
		in real-time upon file selection, prior to the upload. This lets end users decide
		individually, file by file whether overwriting is desired in the current upload
		context or not.</li>
	<li>UploadZen conveniently alerts end users in real-time upon file selection about files
		that are blocked and will be refused by SharePoint, prior to the upload. This <b>saves
			time and bandwidth</b> so that no upload is attempted and performed only to
		fail after the transfer on the server side.</li>
	<li>Resuming uploads that were cancelled half-way, or <b>retrying failed uploads</b>
		could not be easier and smoother than with UploadZen.</li>
	<li>UploadZen lets you <b>compress multiple selected files into a ZIP archive</b> on
		the client-side prior to uploading it (Silverlight users only).</li>
	<li>UploadZen lets your users <b>extract files and sub-folder structures of uploaded
		ZIP archive files</b> on the server side in-place into the target Document Library
		folder.</li>
	<li>UploadZen provides both <b style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;" href="automatic_checkout_batch_checkin_versioning.html">
		automatic check-out and batch check-in</b> (supporting minor/major versioning),
		substantially <b>speeding up your document work-flows</b>.</li>
	<li>SharePoint is picky about many characters it doesn&#39;t like in uploaded file names.
		UploadZen <b>goes the extra mile and removes or replaces them automatically</b>,
		so that your end users will never encounter SharePoint&#39;s <i>&quot;The file name
			is invalid or the file is empty. A file name cannot contain any of the following
			characters...&quot;</i> message &mdash; yet another time and trouble saver.</li>
</ul>
<h3>
	Added benefits specific to WSS 3.0 and MOSS 2007 sites<b style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;" name="s1"></b></h3>
<p>
	In Windows SharePoint Services (WSS) 3.0 and Microsoft Office SharePoint Server
	(MOSS) 2007, the built-in, out-of-box functionality for uploading multiple files
	to a SharePoint Document Library relies on a proprietary Microsoft-supplied <i>ActiveX</i>
	control. The downsides to that approach:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>it restricts multiple uploads to end users with Internet Explorer on Windows only
		&mdash; sub-optimal for Internet-facing web sites</li>
	<li>it requires special end user Internet Explorer security settings to be set and confronts
		them with ambiguous confirmation dialogs</li>
	<li>it is readily available without requiring further client-side installations <i>only</i>
		on client computers that have SharePoint Designer or at least one <i>Microsoft Office
			2007 or 2010</i> application installed (and selected certain SharePoint-related
		client components when they installed that Office application, hidden in some crowded
		setup customization tree view)</li>
</ul>
<p>
	Once you do get this troublesome out-of-the-box <i>ActiveX</i> bulk-file upload
	control to work for at least some of your users, then they can only upload multiple
	files from a single directory in one bulk upload &mdash; but they cannot select
	files from various directories to bulk-upload in one go.</p>
<p>
	Once you decide that the out-of-the-box approaches to bulk document uploads is too
	fickle, or just not useful enough, for you and your end users, <b>UploadZen</b>
	offers a robust and compelling alternative.</p>
<span class="roxadmintopic">
	<div class="rox-info" style="background-image: url('servicenotinstalled.gif');">
		<strong>Note:</strong> after <b style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;" href="setup.html">installing UploadZen to SharePoint</b>,
		deployment is not yet complete. UploadZen will not work properly unless and until
		you have taken <b style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;" href="clickonce_deployment_checklist.html">all steps necessary to
			fully prepare a Web Application for UploadZen</b>.
	</div>
</span><h1 style="page-break-before: always;">Solution Installation</h1><h3>
	1. The UploadZen Setup Package<b style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;" name="s0"></b></h3>
<p>
	The UploadZen setup package (the <b style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;" href="http://roxority.s3.amazonaws.com/roxority_UploadZen.zip">
		roxority_UploadZen.zip</b> file) is a zipped archive containing:</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Deploy.exe</b> &mdash; a graphical user interface (GUI) setup wizard for installing
		and deploying, or retracting and uninstalling UploadZen to and from a SharePoint
		server farm, <b>to be run by a farm administrator user</b> on the &quot;primary&quot;
		SharePoint farm or web front-end server &mdash; in a multi-server farm environment,
		that is the server hosting <i>Central Administration</i>.</li>
	<li><b>docs</b> &mdash; a folder containing this product documentation in Microsoft
		Compiled HTML (CHM) and plain HTML formats.</li>
	<li>Additional supporting files that are <i>required</i> for <b>Deploy.exe</b> to run
		and must neither be modified nor removed.</li>
</ul>
<h3>
	2. Installing the UploadZen Solution Package<b style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;" name="s1"></b></h3>
<p>
	Run <b>Deploy.exe</b> (under user account credentials added to the <i>Farm Administrators</i>
	group in <i>Central Administration</i>, on the &quot;primary&quot; SharePoint farm
	or web front-end server &mdash; in a multi-server farm environment, that is the
	server hosting <i>Central Administration</i>) and when the <i>Welcome</i> screen
	is displayed, click <i>Next</i> to start a series of system checks. To proceed with
	the installation, all system checks need to succeed:</p>
<p class="rox-docpic">
	<img alt="" border="0" class="rox-docpic" style="height: 433px;" src="help/res/setup01.png"
		title="" /></p>
<p>
	Click <i>Next</i> and on the following screen, select the Web Applications to deploy
	UploadZen to. You can also de-select those Site Collections you <i>do not</i> want
	the setup wizard, upon successful deployment, to <i>activate</i> the <b style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;" href="#s2">UploadZen
		Library Integration</b> feature immediately for you on.</p>
<div class="rox-info">
	<b>Note:</b> even when UploadZen is deployed in a Web Application, before you can
	offer your Bulk File Uploads for Document Libraries in a given web site, the <b>UploadZen
		Library Integration</b> <i>Feature</i> needs to be <i>activated</i> for the
	parent Site Collection, as described in the <i>Feature Activation</i> section below.
	For now, the setup wizard performs these activations for you, depending on your
	selections.</div>
<p>
	Click <i>Next</i> to start the installation and wait for the deployment jobs and
	Feature activation to complete. This process can take up to a few minutes.</p>
<p class="rox-docpic">
	<img alt="" border="0" class="rox-docpic" style="height: 433px;" src="help/res/setup03.png"
		title="" /></p>
<p>
	After deployment and Feature activation have completed, review the installation
	log:</p>
<p class="rox-docpic">
	<img alt="" border="0" class="rox-docpic" style="height: 433px;" src="help/res/setup04.png"
		title="" /></p>
<p>
	Once you have successfully completed the setup wizard, you can start defining your
	own custom Multiple-File Uploads (via Site Settings / UploadZen Studio / Upload
	Actions) immediately, or explore the out-of-box, factory default Upload Action interactively immediately.</p>

<h3>
	3. Activating the Site Collection Feature<b style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;" name="s2"></b></h3>
<p>
	The <b>UploadZen Library Integration</b> feature is a <i>SharePoint Site Collection-scoped
		Feature</i>, which needs to be &#39;activated&#39; on each Site Collection it
	is to be used in.</p>
<ol>
	<li>Select <i>Site Settings</i> from the <i>Site Actions</i> menu. </li>
	<li>The <i>Site Settings</i> page contains the <i>Site Collection Administration</i>
		section. In this section, click the <i>Site collection features</i> link. If it
		doesn&#39;t exist, click the <i>Go to top level site settings</i> link in the <i>Site
			Collection Administration</i> section instead, and on the root Web <i>Site Settings</i>
		page now showing, click the <i>Site collection Features</i> link inside the <i>Site
			Collection Administration</i> section. </li>
	<li>The <i>Site Collection Features</i> page (<b>not</b> the <i>Site Features</i> page!)
		should contain a row titled <b>UploadZen Library Integration</b>.
		<ul>
			<li>If it <b>does</b>, click the <i>Activate</i> button to enable your <b style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;" href="itemref_UploadActions.html">
				Upload Actions</b> inside this Site Collection; or click the <i>Deactivate</i> button
				to disable the UploadZen library toolbar menu items and ribbon menu throughout this
				Site Collection.
				<div class="rox-docpic">
					<img alt="" border="0" class="rox-docpic" style="height: 380px;" src="help/res/setup06.png"
						title="" /></div>
			</li>
			<li>If the row <b>doesn&#39;t</b> exist, the <b>UploadZen</b> solution package was not
				yet deployed to this Web Application. On the <i>System Settings</i> page (<i>Operations</i>
				in SharePoint 2007) in the <i>Central Administration</i>, click <i>Manage Farm Solutions</i>
				(<i>Solution management</i> in SharePoint 2007). On the <i>Solution Management</i>
				page, click <b>roxority_uploadzen_xyz.wsp</b> (the <i>xyz</i> part will be different
				depending on your SharePoint version) to open the <i>Solution Properties</i> page.
				Click <i>Deploy Solution</i>, then select this Site Collection&#39;s parent web
				application and click <i>OK</i>. (The deployment is delegated to a background job
				scheduled to run either at the date and time specified, or as soon as possible.
				Once started, it may take this job up to a few minutes to finish deployment.)

<h3>Overwrite existing files with the same name<b style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;" name="s11"></b></h3>
<p><b>(Check box option)</b></p><p>If ticked, uploading files will overwrite any pre-existing files with the same name in the target Document Library folder (but the uploader will highlight existing files prior to the upload so users are notified and can choose to remove the file from the upload). If unticked, if a file with the same name exists in the target Document Library folder, the uploaded file will be rejected by SharePoint.</p>
<h3>Prior to uploading, change all file names to random unique sequences<b style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;" name="s12"></b></h3>
<p><b>(Check box option)</b></p><p>If ticked, this option will change the names of uploaded files to random, but unique sequences so that existing files will never be overwritten.</p>
<h3>Replacement character<b style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;" name="s13"></b></h3>
<p><b>(Text box)</b></p><p>Specify a character or text used to replace the unsupported characters ~ " # % & * : < > ? / \ { | } in uploaded file or folder names. To simply remove (rather than replace) these characters, fully clear this setting. The default value is the underscore (_). (Thanks to this feature, your end users will never receive SharePoint&#39;s "The file name is invalid or the file is empty. A file name cannot contain any of the following characters..." message.)</p>
<p>Default value for new Upload Actions:</p>
<pre>_</pre>
<h3>Auto-remove files marked for upload with blocked file extensions<b style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;" name="s14"></b></h3>
<p><b>(Check box option)</b></p><p>When users select files with name extensions that are "blocked by the administrator" (or by default) on the SharePoint server side (at the Web Application level [SPWebApplication.BlockedFileExtensions]), by default UploadZen will only warn about this (so users can remove the files from the listing) but will technically allow the upload, which SharePoint / IIS will however promptly refuse. Tick this option to have such files automatically removed from the listing when selected for upload, instead.<br/><br/><b>Note:</b> changes to blocked file extensions at the Web Application level are only picked up by UploadZen after all web front-end servers are IIS-reset or restarted.</p>
<h3>File type filters (multi-selectable, no selection = no filters)<b style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;" name="s15"></b></h3>
<p><b>(Drop-down menu to pick from a configurable set of choices)</b></p><p>To restrict which types of files end users can upload via this Upload Action, select one or more file name extension filter sets. If end users then select files whose extensions do not match the selected filters, these files will not even be added to the Upload Files listing and consequently cannot be uploaded.<br/><br/>With the newest Silverlight / Flash versions, these filters even permeate the file browsing dialog and will be offered as choices in there. As a result, users cannot even see or select file types not allowed by the selected filter sets.<br/><br/>(If you need different or custom file name extension filters not offered here, customize or extend the pre-defined filter sets in the Web Uploader section of the Configuration page in UploadZen Studio.)</p>
<p>The drop-down menu provides a set of choices that can be customized on the Configuration page of the UploadZen Studio.</p>
<h3>Maximum file size (read description of this setting first)<b style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;" name="s16"></b></h3>
<p><b>(Text box)</b></p><p>You can optionally restrict the maximum size per file selected for upload. Files exceeding this limit will be automatically removed from the uploader file listing. Leave blank to allow files of any size.<br/><br/><b>Important:</b> the format for this setting is 10B, 100KB, or 1000MB. So use any integer number (no fractional, floats or real numbers) and B for bytes, KB for kilobytes or MB for megabytes, no spaces or other non-numeric characters. (For GB use MB multiplied by 1024, ie. for 2GB use 2048MB instead.)<br/><br/><b>Also note</b> that this setting is a limit for client-side file selection only. Independently of this setting, your SharePoint environment will be subject to server-side request length and upload file size limits on the IIS and SharePoint Web Application levels (refer to the UploadZen Deployment Checklist help topic for details on those limits). To allow uploads of files exceeding these server-side limits, you will need to enable Chunking below.</p>
<h3>File chunk size (read description of this setting first)<b style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;" name="s17"></b></h3>
<p><b>(Text box)</b></p><p>To use this feature, you <b>NEED TO READ</b> the <i>"Preparing a Web Application for the Chunking feature"</i> section in the UploadZen Deployment Checklist help topic in additional to the following information.<br/><br/>While we highly encourage you to increase your server-side request length and upload file size limits as well as request time-outs (as described in the UploadZen Deployment Checklist help topic), you can use this setting to allow uploads of files whose size exceeds your server-side limits by splitting up such files into smaller separate individual chunks that will be put back together into the one original file by UploadZen at the server side once all chunks have been sent. If you choose to use this feature, you need to specify the file chunk size here and this should be slightly lower than your server-side request length / upload file size limits.<br/><br/><b>Example:</b> your server-side limits establish that the maximum upload file size is 50 MB. You can set the chunk size here to "48MB". Then when uploading a 110 MB file, this will be split up into three chunks (pre-upload on the client side), the first two being 48 MB each and the last one being 14 MB, none of which exceeds your server-side limits. UploadZen receives all three chunks and puts them back together to restore the original 110 MB file which is then placed into the target Document Library folder.<br/><br/><b>Important:</b> the format for this setting is 10B, 100KB, or 1000MB. So use any integer number (no fractional, floats or real numbers) and B for bytes, KB for kilobytes or MB for megabytes, no spaces or other non-numeric characters. (For GB use MB multiplied by 1024, ie. for 2GB use 2048MB instead.)</p>
<h3>Auto-shrink images prior to upload (read description of this setting first)<b style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;" name="s18"></b></h3>
<p><b>(Text box)</b></p><p><b>This setting is only used if you specify three integer numbers separated by [,] commas</b>, no other characters. The first number is the maximum image width, the second number is the maximum image height, the third number is the image quality for additional file size compression (1 = worst, 100 = best). For example, if this setting is set to <b>320,240,90</b> then all uploaded images will be resized pre-upload, aspect ratio maintained so that neither the maximum width nor the maximum height is exceeded.</p>
<h3>Offer end users selectable options for server-side ZIP extraction<b style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;" name="s19"></b></h3>
<p><b>(Check box option)</b></p><p>This allows users to select for each individual ZIP archive file marked for upload whether to keep the ZIP in the target Library as is, extract it in-place or extract it in a new sub-folder.</p>
<h3>If Silverlight is used, offer client-side zipping<b style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;" name="s20"></b></h3>
<p><b>(Check box option)</b></p><p>This allows users to define ZIPs to be uploaded in place of the corresponding files marked for zipping. The ZIPs will be generated on the fly just prior to their upload.</p>
<h3>If Silverlight is used, offer a file drop area<b style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;" name="s21"></b></h3>
<p><b>(Check box option)</b></p><p>This allows users to add files to their upload by dragging them from their Explorer or Finder window onto the drop area. <b>Note:</b> if ticked, this option may lead to minimal visual "side effects" on the page (which will not adversely affect or disrupt your users in their work).</p>
<h3>If applicable, by default automatically check in uploaded files as follows<b style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;" name="s22"></b></h3>
<p><b>(Drop-down menu to pick from a set of choices)</b></p><p>Only applies to Libraries that have check-out/check-in enabled. Select whether and how to automatically bulk check in uploaded files. Check-in will appear to have been done by the currently uploading user.</p>
<ul>
<li>No check-in (keep uploaded files checked out to uploading user)</li>
<li>Check in as a minor new version (if minor versions are enabled)</li>
<li>Check in as a major new version (if versions are enabled)</li>
<li>Check in but keep previous version number (&quot;overwrite current version&quot;)</li>
</ul>
<h3>If applicable, allow end users to change the above default check-in per file<b style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;" name="s23"></b></h3>
<p><b>(Check box option)</b></p><p>Only applies to Libraries that have check-out/check-in enabled. If this option is ticked, end users can select for each upload file whether and how to check it in, prior to the upload. The user interface for that selection will for all files default to the check-in option selected above.</p>
<h3>Allow users to launch the Windows Uploader from the Web Uploader<b style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;" name="s24"></b></h3>
<p><b>(Check box option)</b></p><p>Shows a link that launches the legacy Windows Uploader (but this will only show up for pre-Vista Windows clients with Internet Explorer).</p>
</span><h4 class="rox-h4 rox-doctab rox-doctab-z"><b style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;" href="#" onclick="roxTogDocTab('z');">&quot;Windows Uploader&quot; tab:</b></h4><span class="rox-doctab rox-doctab-z">
<h3>Show &#39;Options&#39; tab in the Windows Uploader<b style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;" name="s25"></b></h3>
<p><b>(Check box option)</b></p><p>The Windows Uploader contains an &#39;Options&#39; tab that lets users review or customize certain user-specific client-side UploadZen settings (such as overwriting of existing files). Untick this check box to never show the Options tab to any users.</p>
<h3>Unzipping of uploaded ZIP archive files<b style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;" name="s26"></b></h3>
<p><b>(Drop-down menu to pick from a set of choices)</b></p><p>UploadZen can just put an uploaded ZIP archive file into the current Document Library target folder as a single file, or extract all of its files and sub-folders in place.</p>
<ul>
<li>Let users decide (recommended)</li>
<li>Never unzip</li>
<li>Always unzip</li>
</ul>
<h3>Allow users to store their SharePoint log-in password on their local PC<b style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;" name="s27"></b></h3>
<p><b>(Check box option)</b></p><p>Uploading users may be prompted to type their SharePoint user name and password in certain circumstances (see documentation), and can optionally elect to have UploadZen log them in automatically in the future. This will store their encrypted password in their Windows Registry "Local User" hive. Untick this check box to never let your UploadZen users store their password.</p>
<h3>Allow users to change the target folder<b style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;" name="s28"></b></h3>
<p><b>(Check box option)</b></p><p>The uploader will be initialized to upload to the current Document Library folder, but users can change to another target folder right from within the uploader prior to uploading or between uploads, without having to navigate to that folder first via SharePoint. Untick this check box to never allow users to change the target folder.</p>
<h3>Allow users to change the target Document Library<b style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;" name="s29"></b></h3>
<p><b>(Check box option)</b></p><p>The uploader will be initialized to upload to the current Document Library, but users can change to another target Document Library right from within the uploader prior to uploading or between uploads, without having to navigate to that Document Library first via SharePoint. Untick this check box to never allow users to change the target Document Library.</p>
</span>
<h1 style="page-break-before: always;">Configuration Settings</h1><p>The following configuration settings are available to administrative users on the <span id="roxconfiglink"><i>Configuration</i> page in your <i>UploadZen Studio</i>, which you can access via Site Settings / UploadZen Studio / Configuration Settings</span>.</p><p>Each setting has a global value scoped to the SharePoint server farm, and this value can optionally be overridden on the Site Collection level. The following settings are available:</p>
<h3>User Interface Language<b style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;" name="s0"></b></h3>
<p>UploadZen has been localized for multiple languages. In addition to English and German, if you have added partial translations in other languages (via Site Settings / UploadZen Studio / DIY User Interface Localization), these languages will be available for selection here. Changing this setting affects all UploadZen user interfaces except captions and descriptions of Features, List Templates, Column Types, Content Types or Web Part Templates (those are always loaded directly by SharePoint based on the current Web Site locale).</p>
<p><strong>You can pick one of the following options</strong> on the <i>Configuration</i> page in the <i>UploadZen Studio</i>:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>(Like site, or English)</i></li>
<li><i>English</i></li>
<li><i>Deutsch</i></li>
<li><i>French</i></li>
</ul>
<h3>Hide (2007) or disable (2010) SharePoint&#39;s out-of-box &quot;Upload Multiple Documents&quot; menu item<b style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;" name="s1"></b></h3>
<p>By default, your UploadZen action commands co-exist together with the built-in, out-of-box "Upload Multiple Documents" command. If you intend to fully replace that functionality with UploadZen, you can set whether and when to show (2007) / enable (2010) the built-in, out-of-box "Upload Multiple Documents" command (affects both both the SharePoint 2007 Library "Upload" tool-bar menu and the ribbon menu in the SharePoint 2010 "Documents / New" section of the Library Tools ribbon tab).</p>
<p><strong>You can pick one of the following options</strong> on the <i>Configuration</i> page in the <i>UploadZen Studio</i>:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Never</i></li>
<li><i>Only if Upload Actions exist (requires activated Site Collection feature)</i></li>
<li><i>Always (requires activated Site Collection feature)</i></li>
</ul>
<h3>Hide SharePoint&#39;s out-of-box &quot;Upload Multiple Files&quot; link on the single-upload page<b style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;" name="s2"></b></h3>
<p>By default, your UploadZen action commands co-exist together with the built-in, out-of-box "Upload Multiple Files" link shown on the <b>UploadZen Upload.aspx Replacement Page</b> (if the corresponding Site Collection feature is activated). If you intend to fully replace the built-in functionality with UploadZen, you can set whether and when to show the built-in, out-of-box "Upload Multiple Files" link on the single-upload page.</p>
<p><strong>You can pick one of the following options</strong> on the <i>Configuration</i> page in the <i>UploadZen Studio</i>:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Never</i></li>
<li><i>Only if Upload Actions exist (requires activated Site Collection feature)</i></li>
<li><i>Always (requires activated Site Collection feature)</i></li>
</ul>
<h3>File name extension filter sets<b style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;" name="s3"></b></h3>
<p>You can restrict the file types users can upload in your Upload Action under Site Settings / UploadZen Studio / Upload Actions. If you choose to enable file type filtering, the Upload Action will let you select from the file name extension filter sets defined here. Every filter set is specified in a separate line and contains its name (do not use a comma anywhere in that first part), then a colon [:] and then all allowed file name extensions (without dots), comma-combined.</p>
<p>After you have customized this setting, you can click the <b>Reset to Default Value</b> link on the <i>Configuration</i> page in the <i>UploadZen Studio</i> to restore the following default value:</p>

<h3>Alternative path for temporary file chunk storage location<b style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;" name="s4"></b></h3>
<p>Setting an alternative path is imperative if you want to use the Chunking feature in a multi-server farm environment. In a single-server farm environment or if Chunking is not used, this setting can be ignored. First read the details in the <b>Preparing a Web Application for the Chunking feature</b> section of the UploadZen <b>Deployment Checklist</b> help topic.<br/><br/>If blank, this setting defaults to the current web server&#39;s physical path corresponding to the _layouts/roxority_UploadZen/fc virtual directory. If you need to change this setting, you must set this to a central location accessible from all web front-end servers, such as a network drive, shared folder or other network-mapped location.</p>
<h3>All administrative actions described in the Deployment Checklist have been taken<b style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;" name="s5"></b></h3>
<p>On the <i>Configuration</i> page in the <i>UploadZen Studio</i>, tick this check box after having read the <b style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;" href="clickonce_deployment_checklist.html">ClickOnce Deployment Checklist</b> documentation topic fully and having taken all administrative actions described that are <i>required</i> for UploadZen Windows Uploader to run correctly for all users. (This will hide the reminder notice in the UploadZen window the next time a user launches the UploadZen Windows Uploader from a reloaded page.)</p>
<h3>Always include all debugging and diagnostic details in error messages<b style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;" name="s6"></b></h3>
<p>By default, for certain UploadZen-handled errors only the error message is shown to end users. For debugging and diagnostic purposes, it can occasionally and temporarily be useful to include all known error details such as inner exceptions or the stack trace, but in production this would likely confuse or scare your end users. On the <i>Configuration</i> page in the <i>UploadZen Studio</i>, tick this check box to always include all error details in your end user interfaces.</p>
<h3>Per-File Delay in Seconds<b style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;" name="s7"></b></h3>
<p>Under rare circumstances, you may have to integrate with 3rd-party or custom Event Handlers that work better when there is a slight delay between Document Library events. Specify the number of seconds UploadZen should artificially delay each upload. If you don&#39;t specify an integer number, than the recommended default value of 0 will be used.</p>
<p>After you have customized this setting, you can click the <b>Reset to Default Value</b> link on the <i>Configuration</i> page in the <i>UploadZen Studio</i> to restore the following default value:</p>
<pre>0</pre>
<h3>No default instances of UploadZen configurables on the Site Collection level (NOT recommended!)<b style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;" name="s8"></b></h3>
<p>Configurables are lists of items for defining and customizing the behaviors of this software (such as Export Actions in ExportZen, Data Sources and Data Field Templates in PeopleZen, Print Views and Print Launchers in PrintZen, Upload Actions in UploadZen). By default, each Site Collection has its own non-removable default instance that can be customized and to which additional instances can be added. In extensive farm setups (1000s of Site Collections), these default instances may be a hindrance and using only custom farm-level instances may be preferable. Tick this option to never provide the default instance on the Site Collection level.</p>
<h3>By default, no inclusion of jQuery library v1.6.1 (NOT recommended)<b style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;" name="s9"></b></h3>
<p>Some UploadZen end user-facing artifacts require (and load into the respective host pages) the jQuery library, version 1.6.1. Embedding jQuery more than once in a single page can cause JavaScript warnings in Internet Explorer with <i>some few</i> jQuery plugins (and only if any are used in your farm at all). On the <i>Configuration</i> page in the <i>UploadZen Studio</i>, tick this check box <i>only</i> if your master pages, web pages or third-party extensions also already include jQuery globally (not just on some individual pages) and independently of UploadZen to prevent UploadZen from loading jQuery too. If you do so, you need to make sure jQuery 1.6.1 or higher is loaded on each page hosting also hosting UploadZen user interface artifacts, or UploadZen will appear broken. This is a global default setting that can be optionally overridden locally where applicable.</p>

	Review Server-side Upload Limits<b style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;" name="s0"></b></h3>
<p>
	To support bulk-uploads of large file sets, you may want to review the maximums
	currently supported by your SharePoint server farm.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Review the <i>Maximum Upload Size</i> setting on the <i>Web Application General
		Settings</i> page under <i>Central Administration</i> &rarr; <i>Application Management</i>
		&rarr; <i>SharePoint Web Application Management</i>.</li>
	<li>Internet Information Services (IIS) respects the ASP.NET maximum request length
		setting, pre-empting even the above SharePoint Web Application <i>Maximum Upload Size</i>
		setting. The maximum request length setting is stored and can be modified manually
		in the <i>&lt;wwwroot&gt;\wss\VirtualDirectories\&lt;webapp&gt;\web.config</i> file
		(on each web front-end server) by locating the <i>&lt;httpRuntime&gt;</i> node and
		editing the <i>maxRequestLength</i> attribute value.<ul>
			<li>The stored attribute value represents KB &mdash; divide by 1024 to get the value
				represented in MB (for example, the default value 51200 represents 50 MB). If you
				decide you want to change the setting to a different MB value, multiply that one
				with 1024 and store the result as the new attribute value.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>To prevent a large file upload from timing out before completion, review and customize
		if required the <i>Request execution timeout (seconds)</i> setting on the <i>Application</i>
		tab in the <i>ASP.NET Configuration Settings</i> dialog box by opening the <i>Properties</i>
		dialog box for the SharePoint Web Application in <i>Internet Information Services (IIS)
			Manager</i> on each SharePoint web front-end server and clicking <i>Edit Configuration</i>
		on the <i>ASP.NET</i> tab.</li>
</ul>
<h3>
	Preparing a Web Application for the Chunking feature<b style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;" name="s1"></b></h3>
<p>
	When chunking is used, UploadZen temporarily stores the individual file chunks in
	the <b>_layouts/roxority_UploadZen/fc</b> virtual directory (before putting them
	back together later on to add the original file to the target Document Library folder
	when all chunks have been transferred). This typically corresponds to the <b>C:\Program
		Files\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\Web Server Extensions\14\TEMPLATE\LAYOUTS\roxority_UploadZen\fc\</b>
	physical directory (12 instead of 14 for WSS 3.0 / MOSS 2007) &mdash; unless you
	specified a different target storage folder for chunks on the <b style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;" href="farm_site_config.html">
		Configuration</b> page.</p>
<p>
	When writing to and reading from this directory, UploadZen uses SharePoint code
	elevation so the user account that will access directory will be identical to the
	user account specified as the <b>Identity</b> for the IIS Application Pool (under
	[app pool] / Advanced Settings / Process Model &mdash; more often than not this
	is set to <b>Network Service</b>).
</p>
<p>
	You <b>need to ensure</b> that read and write access to the file chunking temporary
	storage folder (either <i>_layouts/roxority_UploadZen/fc</i> or a custom-configured
	one) is <b>fully granted to the above user account</b>, ie. the IIS app pool identity.
	Note:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>the permissions to check or set are on the Windows Explorer / server-side storage
		OS level rather than IIS / ASP.NET / web server or SharePoint-specific permissions.</li>
	<li>in a multi-server farm environment, you would need to perform the above for all
		<i>_layouts/roxority_UploadZen/fc</i> folders on all web front-end servers; <b>however:</b>
	</li>
	<li>in such an environment you <i>SHOULD</i> instead <b style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;" href="farm_site_config.html">
		re-configure</b> the file chunk temporary storage directory to a central file-system
		location such as a network drive, shared folder or other network-mapped location
		since different chunks might otherwise end up in different <i>_layouts/roxority_UploadZen/fc</i>
		folders on different servers and UploadZen could not put these back together to
		complete the chunked upload as intended.</li>
</ul>
<h3>
	Document Libraries and Other Libraries<b style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;" name="s2"></b></h3>
<p>
	No special preparation considerations apply to Document Libraries or other libraries.
	All Library Views with a their <b>Toolbar Type</b> setting set to either <b>Full Toolbar</b>
	or <b>Show Toolbar</b> provide your <b style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;" href="itemref_UploadActions.html">Upload Actions&#39;</b>
	menu items and may hide the SharePoint <i>Upload Multiple Documents</i> menu item
	if <b style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;" href="farm_site_config.html#s1">so configured</b>.</p>
<h3>
	XSL, Data Form, Data View Web Parts<b style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;" name="s3"></b></h3>
<p>
	If you have in use XSL / Data Form / Data View Web Parts that were created by converting
	from an out-of-the-box Library View (for example using <i>SharePoint Designer</i>),
	keep in mind that their menu structures are &quot;frozen&quot; at conversion time:</p>
<ul>
	<li>the <b>UploadZen</b> menu items will never be visible if <b>UploadZen</b> was not
		activated at conversion time, and</li>
	<li>the <b>UploadZen</b> menu items will always remain visible if <b>UploadZen</b> provided
		active menu items at conversion time.</li>
</ul>
<p>
	If you intend to create such Web Parts by converting from Views, uninstall or disable
	<b>UploadZen</b> temporarily prior to the conversion. You can still generate your
	own <i>Upload Multiple Files</i> links manually and add them to your pages for such
	Web Parts or Document Libraries if desired.</p>
<h3>
	Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)<b style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;" name="s4"></b></h3>
<p>
	<b>UploadZen</b> will work fine over SSL, except when the browser raises a prompt
	about the SSL certificate. The prompt can be raised when there is something wrong
	with the certificate, such as when the site names do not match or the certificate
	has expired. To make <b>UploadZen</b> work over an SSL connection, make sure that
	the certificate is up-to-date, and that the certificate data matches the site data.

<p>
	UploadZen&#39;s legacy <b>Windows Uploader</b> only works for SharePoint site visitors
	using Windows (XP or 2003 only, newer versions no longer support this mode) and
	Internet Explorer (6 - 8 only) or Firefox (with the <b style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;" href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/9449"
		target="_blank">Microsoft .NET Framework Assistant</b> installed).</p>
<div class="rox-info" style="background-image: url('servicenotinstalled.gif');">
	<strong>CAUTION:</strong> the legacy <i>Windows Uploader</i> mode will NOT work
	out of the box for remote clients unless you take the additional administrative
	steps outlined in this section.</div>
<p>
	As a minimum requirement for the legacy <i>Windows Uploader</i> mode to work for
	remote clients (i.e. your users), you need to:</p>
<ol>
	<li>enable both the <i>Browse Directories</i> and the <i>Use Remote Interfaces</i> Site
		Permissions on the <i>User permissions for Web application</i> page (in <i>Central Administration</i>
		&rarr; <i>Application Management</i> &rarr; <i>Application Security</i> &mdash;
		be sure you selected the correct target Web Application), as well as</li>
	<li>perform the following steps in <i>Internet Information Services (IIS) Manager</i>
		on <b>each SharePoint web front-end server</b>:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
	<li>Locate the <i>_layouts/roxority_UploadZen/help</i> virtual directory in the IIS
		Web Site corresponding to the SharePoint Web Application you want to <b>UploadZen</b>-enable.</li>
	<li>If you&#39;re using IIS 6.0 on Windows 2003 server, or IIS 6.0 compatibility mode
		on newer Windows versions :<ul>
			<li>Open the <i>Properties</i> dialog box for the <i>_layouts/roxority_UploadZen/help</i>
				virtual directory from its context menu and on the <i>Directory Security</i> tab,
				in the <i>Authentication and access control</i> section, click the <i>Edit</i> button.</li>
			<li>In the <i>Authentication Methods</i> dialog box, tick the <i>Enable anonymous access</i>
				check box and click OK. Back in the <i>Properties</i> dialog box, click <i>OK</i>.
				(If you are now prompted about applying your changes to child directories or files,
				select all of them in the prompt dialog box and click <i>OK</i>.)</li>
		</ul>
		<p class="rox-docpic">
			<img alt="" border="0" class="rox-docpic" style="height: 449px;" src="help/res/sharepoint-bulk-file-uploads-iis-configuration.png"

		</p>
	</li>
	<li>If you&#39;re using IIS 7.0 or higher, on Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows 2008
		Server or newer Windows operating systems:<ul>
			<li>In the <i>Connections</i> side bar on the left, select the <i>_layouts/roxority_UploadZen/help</i>
				virtual directory in the IIS Web Site corresponding to the SharePoint Web Application
				you want to <b>UploadZen</b>-enable.</li>
			<li>In <i>Features View</i>, double-click the <i>Authentication</i> icon in the <i>IIS</i>
				group. In the <i>Authentication</i> list view, select <i>Anonymous Authentication</i>
				and then click <i>Enable</i> in the <i>Actions</i> side bar on the right.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
<p>
	Granting anonymous read access exclusively to this virtual directory is acceptable
	with regards to server security, since no sensitive information is ever stored underneath
	the <i>help</i> virtual directory, nor does it at all expose access to any server-side
	code anonymous users could ever invoke. Granting this anonymous read access is however
	also <i>required</i> for the legacy <b>Windows Uploader</b> mode to work, as the
	software is based on the Microsoft .NET Framework <i>ClickOnce</i> deployment technology,
	the integration of which with both SharePoint and remote Internet Explorer users
	with varying Windows versions, security and authentication settings more often than
	not simply does not work without making this simple, safe and proven-to-work adjustment.</p>
<p>
	For remote <i>Internet Explorer</i> users, invoking a legacy <i>Windows Uploader</i>
	mode <b style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;" href="itemref_UploadActions.html">Upload Action</b> is likely to produce
	only HTTP 401 error messages <i>unless and until</i> you take the above steps for
	all IIS Web Sites associated with your content Web Applications on all SharePoint
	web front-end servers &mdash; even though the menu item is already available in

<p>As soon and as long as you have at least one ZIP

	<b>UploadZen</b> will generate as described above &mdash; you will find check 
	boxes next to these ZIP archives in the <i>Local Files Marked for Upload</i> 
	area, as demonstrated in the screen shot above. Only tick the check boxes of 
	those ZIP archives you want to extract into the currently selected target 
	Document Library folder. This extraction will happen on the SharePoint server 
	immediately after the ZIP archive has been fully uploaded.</p>
