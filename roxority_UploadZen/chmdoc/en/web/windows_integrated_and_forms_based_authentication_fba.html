<div class="rox-info">
	This topic only applies to the legacy <a href="uploading_multiple_files">Windows
		Uploader</a> mode and is for reference in legacy systems only. You will likely

<h3>
	Preventing Common Authorization Problems<a name="s0"></a></h3>
<p>
	Attempts to launch <b>UploadZen</b> from a Document Library may yield a HTTP 401
	error message, or <b>UploadZen</b> may repeatedly prompt for a user name and password
	that won&#39;t work even when specified correctly for a Full Access account, <i>unless
		and until</i> you take all administrative actions required to <a href="clickonce_deployment_checklist">
			prepare a Web Application for UploadZen</a>.</p>
<h3>
		Automatic Authentication (Single Sign-On) Attempts vs. Log-In Prompts<a name="s1"></a></h3>
<p>
	Under certain circumstances, UploadZen users may be prompted to log in to SharePoint:</p>
<p class="rox-docpic">
	<img alt="" border="0" class="rox-docpic" style="height: 181px;" src="/storage/images/roxority_UploadZen/sharepoint-bulk-file-uploads-forms-based-authentication.png"
		title="" /></p>
<p>
	Generally, <b>UploadZen</b> will attempt to log users in to SharePoint automatically,
	if and only if:</p>
<ul>
	<li>the SharePoint Web Application from which <b>UploadZen</b> is launched uses the
		Windows Integrated authentication mode, and</li>
	<li>the user who launched <b>UploadZen</b> was logged in to SharePoint as the same Windows
		user account used to run their Internet Explorer process.</li>
</ul>
<p>
	Consequently, users may be prompted by <b>UploadZen</b> to log in to SharePoint:</p>
<ul>
	<li>if the SharePoint Web Application from which <b>UploadZen</b> is launched uses the
		Forms-based Authentication (FBA) mode, or</li>
	<li>if the user who launched <b>UploadZen</b> was logged in to SharePoint with a different
		user name than the one they used to run their Internet Explorer process, or</li>
	<li>if they never ticked the Internet Explorer check box &#39;Remember my password&#39; when 
		signing in to SharePoint, or</li>
	<li>if their Internet Explorer or Windows security settings prevented Windows from caching
		their user credentials for this SharePoint Web Application for later use by other
		trusted applications, or</li>
	<li>if <b>UploadZen</b> was denied access to previously cached Windows default 
		credentials for the SharePoint Web Application for any other reasons.</li>
</ul>
<h3>
	Saving User Passwords Locally<a name="s2"></a></h3>
<p>
	When users are prompted by <b>UploadZen</b> to log in to SharePoint, they can elect
	for <b>UploadZen</b> to store their encrypted password in the Windows Registry
	Local User hive and use it automatically in future upload sessions. To disable this
	option for your some or all of your users, consult the appropriate <a href="?doc=farm_site_config#s9">
		server-side configuration setting</a>.</p>
