<h3>
	Review Server-side Upload Limits<a name="s0"></a></h3>
<p>
	To support bulk-uploads of large file sets, you may want to review the maximums
	currently supported by your SharePoint server farm.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Review the <i>Maximum Upload Size</i> setting on the <i>Web Application General
		Settings</i> page under <i>Central Administration</i> &rarr; <i>Application Management</i>
		&rarr; <i>SharePoint Web Application Management</i>.</li>
	<li>Internet Information Services (IIS) respects the ASP.NET maximum request length
		setting, pre-empting even the above SharePoint Web Application <i>Maximum Upload Size</i>
		setting. The maximum request length setting is stored and can be modified manually
		in the <i>&lt;wwwroot&gt;\wss\VirtualDirectories\&lt;webapp&gt;\web.config</i> file
		(on each web front-end server) by locating the <i>&lt;httpRuntime&gt;</i> node and
		editing the <i>maxRequestLength</i> attribute value.<ul>
			<li>The stored attribute value represents KB &mdash; divide by 1024 to get the value
				represented in MB (for example, the default value 51200 represents 50 MB). If you
				decide you want to change the setting to a different MB value, multiply that one
				with 1024 and store the result as the new attribute value.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>To prevent a large file upload from timing out before completion, review and customize
		if required the <i>Request execution timeout (seconds)</i> setting on the <i>Application</i>
		tab in the <i>ASP.NET Configuration Settings</i> dialog box by opening the <i>Properties</i>
		dialog box for the SharePoint Web Application in <i>Internet Information Services (IIS)
			Manager</i> on each SharePoint web front-end server and clicking <i>Edit Configuration</i>
		on the <i>ASP.NET</i> tab.</li>
</ul>
<h3>
	Preparing a Web Application for the Chunking feature<a name="s1"></a></h3>
<p>
	When chunking is used, UploadZen temporarily stores the individual file chunks in
	the <b>_layouts/roxority_UploadZen/fc</b> virtual directory (before putting them
	back together later on to add the original file to the target Document Library folder
	when all chunks have been transferred). This typically corresponds to the <b>C:\Program
		Files\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\Web Server Extensions\14\TEMPLATE\LAYOUTS\roxority_UploadZen\fc\</b>
	physical directory (12 instead of 14 for WSS 3.0 / MOSS 2007) &mdash; unless you
	specified a different target storage folder for chunks on the <a href="farm_site_config">
		Configuration</a> page.</p>
<p>
	When writing to and reading from this directory, UploadZen uses SharePoint code
	elevation so the user account that will access directory will be identical to the
	user account specified as the <b>Identity</b> for the IIS Application Pool (under
	[app pool] / Advanced Settings / Process Model &mdash; more often than not this
	is set to <b>Network Service</b>).
</p>
<p>
	You <b>need to ensure</b> that read and write access to the file chunking temporary
	storage folder (either <i>_layouts/roxority_UploadZen/fc</i> or a custom-configured
	one) is <b>fully granted to the above user account</b>, ie. the IIS app pool identity.
	Note:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>the permissions to check or set are on the Windows Explorer / server-side storage
		OS level rather than IIS / ASP.NET / web server or SharePoint-specific permissions.</li>
	<li>in a multi-server farm environment, you would need to perform the above for all
		<i>_layouts/roxority_UploadZen/fc</i> folders on all web front-end servers; <b>however:</b>
	</li>
	<li>in such an environment you <i>SHOULD</i> instead <a href="farm_site_config">
		re-configure</a> the file chunk temporary storage directory to a central file-system
		location such as a network drive, shared folder or other network-mapped location
		since different chunks might otherwise end up in different <i>_layouts/roxority_UploadZen/fc</i>
		folders on different servers and UploadZen could not put these back together to
		complete the chunked upload as intended.</li>
</ul>
<h3>
	Document Libraries and Other Libraries<a name="s2"></a></h3>
<p>
	No special preparation considerations apply to Document Libraries or other libraries.
	All Library Views with a their <b>Toolbar Type</b> setting set to either <b>Full Toolbar</b>
	or <b>Show Toolbar</b> provide your <a href="itemref_UploadActions">Upload Actions&#39;</a>
	menu items and may hide the SharePoint <i>Upload Multiple Documents</i> menu item
	if <a href="farm_site_config#s1">so configured</a>.</p>
<h3>
	XSL, Data Form, Data View Web Parts<a name="s3"></a></h3>
<p>
	If you have in use XSL / Data Form / Data View Web Parts that were created by converting
	from an out-of-the-box Library View (for example using <i>SharePoint Designer</i>),
	keep in mind that their menu structures are &quot;frozen&quot; at conversion time:</p>
<ul>
	<li>the <b>UploadZen</b> menu items will never be visible if <b>UploadZen</b> was not
		activated at conversion time, and</li>
	<li>the <b>UploadZen</b> menu items will always remain visible if <b>UploadZen</b> provided
		active menu items at conversion time.</li>
</ul>
<p>
	If you intend to create such Web Parts by converting from Views, uninstall or disable
	<b>UploadZen</b> temporarily prior to the conversion. You can still generate your
	own <i>Upload Multiple Files</i> links manually and add them to your pages for such
	Web Parts or Document Libraries if desired.</p>
<h3>
	Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)<a name="s4"></a></h3>
<p>
	<b>UploadZen</b> will work fine over SSL, except when the browser raises a prompt
	about the SSL certificate. The prompt can be raised when there is something wrong
	with the certificate, such as when the site names do not match or the certificate
	has expired. To make <b>UploadZen</b> work over an SSL connection, make sure that
	the certificate is up-to-date, and that the certificate data matches the site data.
</p>
<h3>
	Preparing a Web Application for the Windows Uploader mode<a name="s5"></a></h3>
<div class="rox-info">
	This section only applies to the legacy <a href="uploading_multiple_files">Windows
		Uploader</a> mode and is for reference in legacy systems only. You will likely
	use the newer (and default) <a href="sharepoint_flash_silverlight_clickonce_windows_uploader">
		Web Uploader</a> mode in production instead, and can safely skip this section.</div>
<p>
	UploadZen&#39;s legacy <b>Windows Uploader</b> only works for SharePoint site visitors
	using Windows (XP or 2003 only, newer versions no longer support this mode) and
	Internet Explorer (6 - 8 only) or Firefox (with the <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/9449"
		target="_blank">Microsoft .NET Framework Assistant</a> installed).</p>
<div class="rox-info" style="background-image: url('/storage/images/servicenotinstalled.gif');">
	<strong>CAUTION:</strong> the legacy <i>Windows Uploader</i> mode will NOT work
	out of the box for remote clients unless you take the additional administrative
	steps outlined in this section.</div>
<p>
	As a minimum requirement for the legacy <i>Windows Uploader</i> mode to work for
	remote clients (i.e. your users), you need to:</p>
<ol>
	<li>enable both the <i>Browse Directories</i> and the <i>Use Remote Interfaces</i> Site
		Permissions on the <i>User permissions for Web application</i> page (in <i>Central Administration</i>
		&rarr; <i>Application Management</i> &rarr; <i>Application Security</i> &mdash;
		be sure you selected the correct target Web Application), as well as</li>
	<li>perform the following steps in <i>Internet Information Services (IIS) Manager</i>
		on <b>each SharePoint web front-end server</b>:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
	<li>Locate the <i>_layouts/roxority_UploadZen/help</i> virtual directory in the IIS
		Web Site corresponding to the SharePoint Web Application you want to <b>UploadZen</b>-enable.</li>
	<li>If you&#39;re using IIS 6.0 on Windows 2003 server, or IIS 6.0 compatibility mode
		on newer Windows versions :<ul>
			<li>Open the <i>Properties</i> dialog box for the <i>_layouts/roxority_UploadZen/help</i>
				virtual directory from its context menu and on the <i>Directory Security</i> tab,
				in the <i>Authentication and access control</i> section, click the <i>Edit</i> button.</li>
			<li>In the <i>Authentication Methods</i> dialog box, tick the <i>Enable anonymous access</i>
				check box and click OK. Back in the <i>Properties</i> dialog box, click <i>OK</i>.
				(If you are now prompted about applying your changes to child directories or files,
				select all of them in the prompt dialog box and click <i>OK</i>.)</li>
		</ul>
		<p class="rox-docpic">
			<img alt="" border="0" class="rox-docpic" style="height: 449px;" src="/storage/images/roxority_UploadZen/sharepoint-bulk-file-uploads-iis-configuration.png"
				title="" />
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>If you&#39;re using IIS 7.0 or higher, on Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows 2008
		Server or newer Windows operating systems:<ul>
			<li>In the <i>Connections</i> side bar on the left, select the <i>_layouts/roxority_UploadZen/help</i>
				virtual directory in the IIS Web Site corresponding to the SharePoint Web Application
				you want to <b>UploadZen</b>-enable.</li>
			<li>In <i>Features View</i>, double-click the <i>Authentication</i> icon in the <i>IIS</i>
				group. In the <i>Authentication</i> list view, select <i>Anonymous Authentication</i>
				and then click <i>Enable</i> in the <i>Actions</i> side bar on the right.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
<p>
	Granting anonymous read access exclusively to this virtual directory is acceptable
	with regards to server security, since no sensitive information is ever stored underneath
	the <i>help</i> virtual directory, nor does it at all expose access to any server-side
	code anonymous users could ever invoke. Granting this anonymous read access is however
	also <i>required</i> for the legacy <b>Windows Uploader</b> mode to work, as the
	software is based on the Microsoft .NET Framework <i>ClickOnce</i> deployment technology,
	the integration of which with both SharePoint and remote Internet Explorer users
	with varying Windows versions, security and authentication settings more often than
	not simply does not work without making this simple, safe and proven-to-work adjustment.</p>
<p>
	For remote <i>Internet Explorer</i> users, invoking a legacy <i>Windows Uploader</i>
	mode <a href="itemref_UploadActions">Upload Action</a> is likely to produce
	only HTTP 401 error messages <i>unless and until</i> you take the above steps for
	all IIS Web Sites associated with your content Web Applications on all SharePoint
	web front-end servers &mdash; even though the menu item is already available in
	all Document Library <i>Upload</i> menus throughout your server farm immediately
	after <a href="setup">solution installation</a>.</p>
<h3>
	Granting Web Service Access<a name="s6"></a></h3>
<div class="rox-info">
	This section only applies to the legacy <a href="uploading_multiple_files">Windows
		Uploader</a> mode and is for reference in legacy systems only. You will likely
	use the newer (and default) <a href="sharepoint_flash_silverlight_clickonce_windows_uploader">
		Web Uploader</a> mode in production instead, and can safely skip this section.</div>
<p>
	While running, the legacy <b>Windows Uploader</b> window will attempt to access
	via HTTP / SOAP, under the user-specified credentials, the following XML Web Services:</p>
<ul>
	<li><i><s>http://site/_layouts/roxority_UploadZen/Files.asmx</s> http://site/_layouts/roxority_UploadZen/uploadzen.aspx</i></li>
	<li><i>http://site/_vti_bin/Lists.asmx</i></li>
	<li><i>http://site/_vti_bin/SiteData.asmx</i></li>
	<li><i>http://site/_vti_bin/Authentication.asmx</i></li>
</ul>
<p>
	It is the responsibility of the administrator deploying a legacy <b>Windows Uploader</b>
	mode <a href="itemref_UploadActions">Upload Action</a> to make sure that remote
	users are granted access to these interfaces. In most environments, completing the
	<a href="#s4">steps outlined above</a> should be sufficient to grant this access.</p>
<h3>
	Proxy Authentication<a name="s7"></a></h3>
<div class="rox-info">
	This section only applies to the legacy <a href="uploading_multiple_files">Windows
		Uploader</a> mode and is for reference in legacy systems only. You will likely

		Web Uploader</a> mode in production instead, and can safely skip this section.</div>
<p>
	For the legacy <b>Windows Uploader</b> mode to work with default proxy authentication
	in a corporate setting, the <i>defaultProxy</i> element in the .NET Framework <i>machine.config</i>
	file on all client computers (under <i>%WINDIR%\Microsoft.NET\Framework\&lt;version&gt;\CONFIG\</i>)
	must be set to allow <i>System.Net</i> to use default security credentials. Alternatively,
	you can configure <i>defaultProxy</i> on client computers to use a specific proxy
	server.</p>
