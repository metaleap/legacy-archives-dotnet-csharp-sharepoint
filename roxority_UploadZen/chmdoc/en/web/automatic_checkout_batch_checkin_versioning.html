<ul>
	<li><b>No</b> &mdash; uploaded files stay checked out to you</li>
	<li><b>As minor new version</b> &mdash; uploaded files are checked in. Overwritten,
		previously existing files get a minor version number increment (ie. from 1.0 to
		1.1 etc.) if the <b>Document Version History</b> for this Document Library is set
		to <b>Create major and minor (draft) versions</b> (on the <b>Versioning Settings</b>
		page under <b>Document Library Settings</b>).</li>
	<li><b>As major new version</b> &mdash; uploaded files are checked in. Overwritten,
		previously existing files get a manor version number increment (ie. from 1.0 to
		2.0 etc.) <i>unless</i> the <b>Document Version History</b> for this Document Library
		is set to <b>No versioning</b> (on the <b>Versioning Settings</b> page under <b>Document
			Library Settings</b>).</li>
	<li><b>Overwrite current version</b> &mdash; uploaded files are checked in but if the
		file name already existed prior to the upload, the previous version number remains
		unchanged.</li>
</ul>
<p>
	To check in all files the same way, select the preferred setting for one file, then
	click the
