	<h1>Introduction</h1>
<h3>
	Why Use UploadZen for SharePoint Bulk-File Uploads?<a name="s0"></a></h3>
<p>
	UploadZen provides a much more sophisticated upload experience for your SharePoint
	document management efforts than the rather &quot;lightweight&quot; out-of-box upload
	tools do.</p>
<ul>
	<li>The SharePoint 2010 multi-upload function is based exclusively on the proprietary
		<i>Microsoft Silverlight</i> plugin, restricting the feature to a small sub-set
		of real-world users. UploadZen supports both <i>Flash and Silverlight</i>, <b>supporting
			a much higher percentage (90+%)</b> of your web site visitors and end users.</li>
	<li>Just like the out-of-box uploader, administrators can simply allow uploading of
		any and all file types and sizes into any Library. Unlike the built-in uploader,
		UploadZen lets them also <b>set up fine-grained rules prescribing exactly</b> which
		<a href="itemref_UploadActions.html">file types (ie. filter by allowing images-only,
			documents-only etc.) and/or sizes are allowed into which types of Libraries</a>.</li>
	<li>UploadZen provides <i>Chunking</i> for uploading files of <b>any size, including
		GB-sized files</b>, regardless of your server-side request length or file size limits.</li>
	<li>UploadZen allows for client-side <b>on-the-fly image resizing</b> prior to the upload,
		resulting in much faster upload times and substantial bandwidth savings.</li>
	<li>UploadZen conveniently <b>alerts end users about existing files with the same name</b>
		in real-time upon file selection, prior to the upload. This lets end users decide
		individually, file by file whether overwriting is desired in the current upload
		context or not.</li>
	<li>UploadZen conveniently alerts end users in real-time upon file selection about files
		that are blocked and will be refused by SharePoint, prior to the upload. This <b>saves
			time and bandwidth</b> so that no upload is attempted and performed only to
		fail after the transfer on the server side.</li>
	<li>Resuming uploads that were cancelled half-way, or <b>retrying failed uploads</b>
		could not be easier and smoother than with UploadZen.</li>
	<li>UploadZen lets you <b>compress multiple selected files into a ZIP archive</b> on
		the client-side prior to uploading it (Silverlight users only).</li>
	<li>UploadZen lets your users <b>extract files and sub-folder structures of uploaded
		ZIP archive files</b> on the server side in-place into the target Document Library
		folder.</li>
	<li>UploadZen provides both <a href="automatic_checkout_batch_checkin_versioning.html">
		automatic check-out and batch check-in</a> (supporting minor/major versioning),
		substantially <b>speeding up your document work-flows</b>.</li>
	<li>SharePoint is picky about many characters it doesn&#39;t like in uploaded file names.
		UploadZen <b>goes the extra mile and removes or replaces them automatically</b>,
		so that your end users will never encounter SharePoint&#39;s <i>&quot;The file name
			is invalid or the file is empty. A file name cannot contain any of the following
			characters...&quot;</i> message &mdash; yet another time and trouble saver.</li>
</ul>
<h3>
	Added benefits specific to WSS 3.0 and MOSS 2007 sites<a name="s1"></a></h3>
<p>
	In Windows SharePoint Services (WSS) 3.0 and Microsoft Office SharePoint Server
	(MOSS) 2007, the built-in, out-of-box functionality for uploading multiple files
	to a SharePoint Document Library relies on a proprietary Microsoft-supplied <i>ActiveX</i>
	control. The downsides to that approach:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>it restricts multiple uploads to end users with Internet Explorer on Windows only
		&mdash; sub-optimal for Internet-facing web sites</li>
	<li>it requires special end user Internet Explorer security settings to be set and confronts
		them with ambiguous confirmation dialogs</li>
	<li>it is readily available without requiring further client-side installations <i>only</i>
		on client computers that have SharePoint Designer or at least one <i>Microsoft Office
			2007 or 2010</i> application installed (and selected certain SharePoint-related
		client components when they installed that Office application, hidden in some crowded
		setup customization tree view)</li>
</ul>
<p>
	Once you do get this troublesome out-of-the-box <i>ActiveX</i> bulk-file upload
	control to work for at least some of your users, then they can only upload multiple
	files from a single directory in one bulk upload &mdash; but they cannot select
	files from various directories to bulk-upload in one go.</p>
<p>
	Once you decide that the out-of-the-box approaches to bulk document uploads is too
	fickle, or just not useful enough, for you and your end users, <b>UploadZen</b>
	offers a robust and compelling alternative.</p>
