<p>The following configuration settings are available to administrative users on the <span id="roxconfiglink"><i>Configuration</i> page in your <i>UploadZen Studio</i>, which you can access via Site Settings / UploadZen Studio / Configuration Settings</span>.</p><p>Each setting has a global value scoped to the SharePoint server farm, and this value can optionally be overridden on the Site Collection level. The following settings are available:</p>
<h3>User Interface Language</h3>
<p>UploadZen has been localized for multiple languages. In addition to English and German, if you have added partial translations in other languages (via Site Settings / UploadZen Studio / DIY User Interface Localization), these languages will be available for selection here. Changing this setting affects all UploadZen user interfaces except captions and descriptions of Features, List Templates, Column Types, Content Types or Web Part Templates (those are always loaded directly by SharePoint based on the current Web Site locale).</p>
<p><strong>You can pick one of the following options</strong> on the <i>Configuration</i> page in the <i>UploadZen Studio</i>:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>(Like site, or English)</i></li>
<li><i>English</i></li>
<li><i>Deutsch</i></li>
</ul>
<h3>Disable SharePoint&#39;s out-of-box &quot;Upload Multiple Documents&quot; menu item</h3>
<p>By default, your UploadZen action commands co-exist together with the built-in, out-of-box "Upload Multiple Documents" command. If you intend to fully replace that functionality with UploadZen, you can set whether and when to disable the built-in, out-of-box "Upload Multiple Documents" command (affects both both the SharePoint 2007 Library "Upload" tool-bar menu and the ribbon menu in the SharePoint 2010/2013 "Documents / New" section of the Library Tools ribbon tab).</p>
<p><strong>You can pick one of the following options</strong> on the <i>Configuration</i> page in the <i>UploadZen Studio</i>:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Never</i></li>
<li><i>Only if Upload Actions exist (requires activated Site Collection feature)</i></li>
<li><i>Always (requires activated Site Collection feature)</i></li>
</ul>
<h3>Hide SharePoint&#39;s out-of-box &quot;Upload Multiple Files&quot; link on the single-upload page</h3>
<p>By default, your UploadZen action commands co-exist together with the built-in, out-of-box "Upload Multiple Files" link shown on the <b>UploadZen Upload.aspx Replacement Page</b> (if the corresponding Site Collection feature is activated). If you intend to fully replace the built-in functionality with UploadZen, you can set whether and when to show the built-in, out-of-box "Upload Multiple Files" link on the single-upload page.</p>
<p><strong>You can pick one of the following options</strong> on the <i>Configuration</i> page in the <i>UploadZen Studio</i>:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Never</i></li>
<li><i>Only if Upload Actions exist (requires activated Site Collection feature)</i></li>
<li><i>Always (requires activated Site Collection feature)</i></li>
</ul>
<h3>Permission context for ribbon buttons / tool-bar menu items</h3>
<p><b>The default selection is the recommended choice here and we would advise you against changing this unless you have a sound reason to do so.</b><br/><br/>Select which permissions must be granted to end users for them to be able to use the ribbon buttons / tool-bar menu items provided by this software.</p>
<p><strong>You can pick one of the following options</strong> on the <i>Configuration</i> page in the <i>UploadZen Studio</i>:</p>

<p>After you have customized this setting, you can click the <b>Reset to Default Value</b> link on the <i>Configuration</i> page in the <i>UploadZen Studio</i> to restore the following default value:</p>
<pre>AddListItems</pre>
<h3>File name extension filter sets</h3>
<p>You can restrict the file types users can upload in your Upload Action under Site Settings / UploadZen Studio / Upload Actions. If you choose to enable file type filtering, the Upload Action will let you select from the file name extension filter sets defined here. Every filter set is specified in a separate line and contains its name (do not use a comma anywhere in that first part), then a colon [:] and then all allowed file name extensions (without dots), comma-combined.</p>
<p>After you have customized this setting, you can click the <b>Reset to Default Value</b> link on the <i>Configuration</i> page in the <i>UploadZen Studio</i> to restore the following default value:</p>
<pre>Documents (*.pdf; *.doc; *.rtf etc.):123,602,cgm,csv,dbf,dif,doc,docx,docm,dot,dotx,hta,htm,html,hwp,mml,odb,odf,odm,odp,ods,odt,oth,otp,ott,pdb,pdf,pot,potm,potx,pps,ppt,pptm,pptx,psw,pxl,rtf,sdc,sdp,sdw,sgl,slk,smf,stc,sti,stw,sxc,sxg,sxm,sxi,sxw,txt,uof,uos,uof,uop,uot,vor,wb2,wpd,wk1,wks,wri,xlc,xlm,xltm,xltx,xls,xlsb,xlsm,xlsx,xlt,xlw,xml<br/>Pictures (*.jpg; *.png; *.gif etc.):bmp,dxf,dib,emf,eps,gif,ico,jfif,jif,jpe,jpeg,jpg,met,odg,otg,pbm,pcd,pct,pcx,pgm,pict,png,ppm,psd,ras,sda,sdd,sgf,sgv,std,svm,svg,sxd,tga,tif,tiff,vor,wmf,xbm,xpm<br/>Web Parts (*.dwp; *.webpart):dwp,webpart<br/>List Template / Site Template / Solution Packages (*.stp; *.cab; *.wsp):stp,cab,wsp<br/>Master Pages (*.master):master<br/>Compressed File Archives (*.zip; *.rar etc.):zip,rar,wsp,stp,cab,arj,lzh,ace,tar,gz,gzip,uue,bz2,jar,iso,z,7z</pre>
<h3>Alternative path for temporary file chunk storage location</h3>
<p>Setting an alternative path is imperative if you want to use the Chunking feature in a multi-server farm environment. In a single-server farm environment or if Chunking is not used, this setting can be ignored. First read the details in the <b>Preparing a Web Application for the Chunking feature</b> section of the UploadZen <b>Deployment Checklist</b> help topic.<br/><br/>If blank, this setting defaults to the current web server&#39;s physical path corresponding to the _layouts/roxority_UploadZen/fc virtual directory. If you need to change this setting, you must set this to a central location accessible from all web front-end servers, such as a network drive, shared folder or other network-mapped location.</p>
<h3>Hide Check-In drop-downs if disabled</h3>
<p></p>
<h3>All administrative actions described in the Deployment Checklist have been taken</h3>
<p>On the <i>Configuration</i> page in the <i>UploadZen Studio</i>, tick this check box after having read the <a href="?doc=clickonce_deployment_checklist">ClickOnce Deployment Checklist</a> documentation topic fully and having taken all administrative actions described that are <i>required</i> for UploadZen Windows Uploader to run correctly for all users. (This will hide the reminder notice in the UploadZen window the next time a user launches the UploadZen Windows Uploader from a reloaded page.)</p>
<h3>Always include all debugging and diagnostic details in error messages</h3>
<p>By default, for certain UploadZen-handled errors only the error message is shown to end users. For debugging and diagnostic purposes, it can occasionally and temporarily be useful to include all known error details such as inner exceptions or the stack trace, but in production this would likely confuse or scare your end users. On the <i>Configuration</i> page in the <i>UploadZen Studio</i>, tick this check box to always include all error details in your end user interfaces.</p>
<h3>Per-File Delay in Seconds</h3>
<p>Under rare circumstances, you may have to integrate with 3rd-party or custom Event Handlers that work better when there is a slight delay between Document Library events. Specify the number of seconds UploadZen should artificially delay each upload. If you don&#39;t specify an integer number, than the recommended default value of 0 will be used.</p>
<p>After you have customized this setting, you can click the <b>Reset to Default Value</b> link on the <i>Configuration</i> page in the <i>UploadZen Studio</i> to restore the following default value:</p>
<pre>0</pre>
<h3>No default instances of UploadZen configurables on the Site Collection level (NOT recommended!)</h3>
<p>Configurables are lists of items for defining and customizing the behaviors of this software (such as Export Actions in ExportZen, Data Sources and Data Field Templates in PeopleZen, Print Views and Print Launchers in PrintZen, Upload Actions in UploadZen). By default, each Site Collection has its own non-removable default instance that can be customized and to which additional instances can be added. In extensive farm setups (1000s of Site Collections), these default instances may be a hindrance and using only custom farm-level instances may be preferable. Tick this option to never provide the default instance on the Site Collection level.</p>
<h3>By default, no inclusion of jQuery library v1.8.3 (NOT recommended)</h3>
<p>Some UploadZen end user-facing artifacts may require, and load into the respective host pages, the jQuery library. Embedding jQuery more than once in a single page can sometimes cause issues. On the <i>Configuration</i> page in the <i>UploadZen Studio</i>, tick this check box <i>only</i> if your master pages, web pages or third-party extensions also already include jQuery globally (not just on some individual pages) and do so independently of UploadZen, to prevent UploadZen from loading jQuery redundantly. If you do so, you need to make sure jQuery (any version higher than 1.4 BUT lower than 1.9) is loaded on each page also hosting UploadZen user interface artifacts, or UploadZen will appear broken. This is a global default setting that may be optionally overridden locally where applicable.</p>
