<h3>
	Bulk-uploading entire folder structures</h3>
<p>
	<b>UploadZen</b> lets you upload entire directory hierarchies including all (<a href="?doc=client_side_settings#s4">or
		only certain</a>) files and sub-directories by simply marking a directory for upload.</p>
<p>
	To mark a directory for bulk upload, you can <b>either</b> navigate to it by clicking
	the
	<img class="roxbuttonicon" src="help/res/openfolderHS.png" />
	<i>Change Folder</i> button, then selecting from the
	<img class="roxbuttonicon" src="help/res/openfolderHS.png" />
	<i>Change Folder</i> drop-down menu the appropriate <i>Mark entire folder contents (files
		and sub-folders) for upload</i> menu item...</p>
<p class="rox-docpic">
	<img alt="" border="0" class="rox-docpic" style="height: 154px;" src="help/res/sharepoint-bulk-folder-uploads-01.png"
		title="" /></p>
<p>
	... <b>or</b> you can first select the folder(s) inside the local file navigation
	area and then from the context menu select either the <i>Mark selected folders, their
		files and sub-folders for upload</i> menu item or the <i>Mark files and sub-folders
			of selected folders for upload</i> menu item. (The second menu item will
	place the files and sub-folders directly into the currently selected Document Library
	target folder, the former will re-create the folder inside the currently selected
	Document Library target folder, then place the files and sub-folders inside that
	newly created folder.)</p>

	<img alt="" border="0" class="rox-docpic" style="height: 210px;" src="help/res/sharepoint-bulk-folder-uploads-02.png"
		title="" /></p>
<p>
	Once you have marked all folders for bulk-upload, click the
	<img class="roxbuttonicon" src="help/res/PublishPlanHS.png" />
	<i>Upload Files</i> button to initiate the bulk-upload. Each directory will be 
	ZIP-compressed in its entirety (in memory) for transfer:</p>
<p class="rox-docpic">
	<img alt="" border="0" class="rox-docpic" style="height: 148px;" src="help/res/sharepoint-bulk-folder-uploads-zip-compression.png"
		title="" /></p>
<p>
	<b>UploadZen</b> then uploads the in-memory ZIP archive to SharePoint where it will be 
	extracted into the currently selected target Document Library folder.</p>
<h3>
	Uploading multiple files as a dynamically generated ZIP archive</h3>
<p>Sometimes you want to put together a number of related files in one ZIP archive 
	for uploading. <b>UploadZen</b> saves you the step of manually compressing files 
	into a ZIP archive with an external tool; instead, you can simply select the 
	files and tell <b>UploadZen</b> to compress those files into a ZIP archive which 
	to upload in place of the individual files using the context menu:</p>
<p class="rox-docpic">
	<img alt="" border="0" class="rox-docpic" style="height: 250px;" src="help/res/sharepoint-upload-multiple-files-zip-compressed.png"
		title="" /></p>
<p>This will put a single item (with a prefix [ZIP] and the names of the included 
	files) into the <i>Local Files Marked for Upload</i> area, representing the 
	dynamic ZIP archive that will be generated automatically once you start your 
	upload:</p>

<h3>
	Server-side unzipping of uploaded ZIP archive files</h3>
<p>As soon and as long as you have at least one ZIP 
	archive marked for upload &mdash; whether an existing archive file you selected from your file system, or a dynamic ZIP that 
	<b>UploadZen</b> will generate as described above &mdash; you will find check 
	boxes next to these ZIP archives in the <i>Local Files Marked for Upload</i> 
	area, as demonstrated in the screen shot above. Only tick the check boxes of 
	those ZIP archives you want to extract into the currently selected target 
	Document Library folder. This extraction will happen on the SharePoint server 
	immediately after the ZIP archive has been fully uploaded.</p>
