<h3>
	(General) Maximum picture file preview icons per folder</h3>
<p>
	Picture files are represented by an icon showing a preview of their content but
	this consumes additional system resources. Specify the maximum number of picture
	files that a folder can contain before preview icons are turned off for that folder.
	Use 0 to never show any preview icons.</p>
<h3>
	(General) Apply the [xyz] file filter when targeting a [xyz] Library</h3>
<p>
	Choose &#39;Yes&#39; to automatically select a file filter for the local file browsing
	area suitable for the target Document Library, or &#39;No&#39; to never automatically
	change your file filters.</p>
<h3>
	(Upload) Overwrite existing files</h3>
<p>
	Select &#39;Yes&#39; to overwrite files that already exist in the SharePoint Document
	Library target folder under the given name, or &#39;No&#39; to not replace the existing
	file and produce a warning message instead.</p>
<h3>
	(Upload) Replacement character</h3>
<p>
	Specify a character or text used to replace each unwanted character, ie. &tilde;
	&quot; # % &amp; * : &lt; &gt; ? / \ { | and } in uploaded file or folder names.
	(Clear this to simply remove the unwanted characters.)</p>

		be accessed by the current user (default: <i>No</i>)<ul>
			<li>Files / folders that cannot be accessed by the current user can never be included
				in folder bulk uploads. For the inclusion sections, this setting controls whether
				to ignore-and-skip those files / folders (if set to <i>No</i>) or show an error
				message for each such file / folder (if set to <i>Yes</i>).</li>
		</ul>
	</li>

		for upload at the SharePoint web application level (default: <i>No</i>)</li>

		file system attribute is set (default: <i>Yes</i> except for <i>Hidden, Offline</i>,
		<i>Sparse</i>, <i>System</i>, <i>Temporary</i>)</li>
