<h3>
	1. The UploadZen Setup Package</h3>
<p>
	The UploadZen setup package (the <a href="http://roxority.s3.amazonaws.com/roxority_UploadZen.zip">
		roxority_UploadZen.zip</a> file) is a zipped archive containing:</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Inst_2013.exe</b> &mdash; a setup wizard for adding or removing UploadZen
	to/from the SharePoint 2013 server farm, <b>to be run by a farm administrator user</b> on the &quot;primary&quot;
		SharePoint 2013 farm server &mdash; in a multi-server farm environment,
		that is the server hosting <i>Central Administration</i>.</li>
	<li><b>Inst_2010_2007.exe</b> &mdash; a setup wizard for adding or removing UploadZen
	to/from the SharePoint 2010 or SharePoint 2007 server farm, <b>to be run by a farm administrator user</b> on the &quot;primary&quot;
		SharePoint 2010/2007 farm server &mdash; in a multi-server farm environment,
		that is the server hosting <i>Central Administration</i>.</li>
	<li>Additional supporting files (such as the solution package/s) that are <i>required</i> for <b>Inst_2013.exe</b> and <b>Inst_2010_2007.exe</b> to run
		and must neither be modified nor removed.</li>
</ul>
<h3>
	2. Installing / uninstalling the UploadZen Solution Package</h3>
<p>
	Run <b>Inst_2013.exe</b> (for SharePoint 2013) or <b>Inst_2010_2007.exe</b> (for SharePoint 2010 or 2007) &mdash; <b>DO SO ONLY:</b></p>
<ul>
	<li>on the &quot;primary&quot; SharePoint farm
	server &mdash; in a multi-server farm environment, that is the
	server hosting <i>Central Administration</i></li>
	<li>under user account credentials that are added to the <i>Farm Administrators</i>
	group in your SharePoint <i>Central Administration</i></li>
</ul>
<ol>
	<li>
	<b>Deinstallation:</b> &mdash; the setup wizard will first determine whether any version of UploadZen is currently deployed or installed in the server farm.
	<ul><li>If so, it <i>immediately proceeds</i> to retract it from all Web Applications,</li><li>then removes it from the server farm&#39;s solution store.</li></ul>
	</li>
	<li>
	<b>(Re)installation:</b> &mdash; the setup wizard will then prompt you whether to proceed installing and deploying UploadZen to your SharePoint server farm:
	</li>
</ol>

<div class="rox-info">
	<b>Notes:</b>
	<ul>
	<li>We <i>highly</i> recommend performing a full IISRESET on all farm servers after the setup wizard has finished.</li>
	<li>
	Even when UploadZen is deployed in a Web Application, before you can
	offer your Bulk File Uploads for Document Libraries in a given Site, the <b>UploadZen
		Library Integration</b> <i>Site Collection Feature</i> needs to be <i>activated</i> for the
	parent Site Collection, as described in the <i>Feature Activation</i> section below. (The setup wizard will <i>attempt</i> to
	perform these Feature Activations for you, but does not check whether this succeeded.)
	</li>
	</div>
<p>
	Once you have successfully completed the setup wizard, you can start defining your
	own custom Multiple-File Uploads (via Site Settings / UploadZen Studio / Upload
	Actions) immediately, or explore the out-of-box, factory default Upload Action interactively immediately.</p>
<h3>
	3. Activating the Site Collection Feature</h3>
<p>
	The <b>UploadZen Library Integration</b> feature is a <i>SharePoint Site Collection-scoped
		Feature</i>, which needs to be &#39;activated&#39; on each Site Collection it
	is to be used in.</p>
<ol>
	<li>Select <i>Site Settings</i> from the <i>Site Actions</i> menu. </li>
	<li>The <i>Site Settings</i> page contains the <i>Site Collection Administration</i>
		section. In this section, click the <i>Site collection features</i> link. If it
		doesn&#39;t exist, click the <i>Go to top level site settings</i> link in the <i>Site
			Collection Administration</i> section instead, and on the root Web <i>Site Settings</i>
		page now showing, click the <i>Site collection Features</i> link inside the <i>Site
			Collection Administration</i> section. </li>
	<li>The <i>Site Collection Features</i> page (<b>not</b> the <i>Site Features</i> page!)
		should contain a row titled <b>UploadZen Library Integration</b>.
		<ul>
			<li>If it <b>does</b>, click the <i>Activate</i> button to enable your <a href="?doc=itemref_UploadActions">
				Upload Actions</a> inside this Site Collection; or click the <i>Deactivate</i> button
				to disable the UploadZen library toolbar menu items and ribbon menu throughout this
				Site Collection.

						title="" /></div>
			</li>
			<li>If the row <b>doesn&#39;t</b> exist, the <b>UploadZen</b> solution package was not
				yet deployed to this Web Application. On the <i>System Settings</i> page (<i>Operations</i>
				in SharePoint 2007) in the <i>Central Administration</i>, click <i>Manage Farm Solutions</i>
				(<i>Solution management</i> in SharePoint 2007). On the <i>Solution Management</i>
				page, click <b>roxority_uploadzen_xyz.wsp</b> (the <i>xyz</i> part will be different
				depending on your SharePoint version) to open the <i>Solution Properties</i> page.
				Click <i>Deploy Solution</i>, then select this Site Collection&#39;s parent web
				application and click <i>OK</i>. (The deployment is delegated to a background job
				scheduled to run either at the date and time specified, or as soon as possible.
				Once started, it may take this job up to a few minutes to finish deployment.)
