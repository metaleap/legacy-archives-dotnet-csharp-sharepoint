<h3>
	End user experience of launching the Web Uploader</h3>
<p>
	After UploadZen has been <a href="?doc=setup">installed</a>, <a href="?doc=clickonce_deployment_checklist">
		fully deployed</a> and its <i>UploadZen Library Integration</i> Site Collection
	<a href="?doc=setup#s2">feature activated</a>:</p>
<ul>
	<li>navigate to any Form Library, Picture Library, Slide Library, Translation Management
		Library, Web Part Gallery, Master Page Gallery, List / Site Template Gallery or
		any other <b>SharePoint Document Library</b></li>
	<li><i>or</i> select any <b>Library View Web Part</b> (with its <i>Toolbar Type</i>
		set to <i>Show</i> or <i>Full</i>) on any of your content, wiki or Web Part pages</li>
	<li>and then switch to the <i>Documents</i> ribbon tab in the <i>Library Tools</i> ribbon
		group.</li>
</ul>
<p>
	In addition to the SharePoint <i>Upload Document</i> menu, you should also see an
	<i>Upload Multiple Files</i> button in the ribbon section titled <i>New</i>:</p>
<p class="rox-docpic">
	<img alt="" border="0" class="rox-docpic" style="height: 348px;" src="help/res/sharepoint-flash-silverlight-multi-upload-ribbon.png"
		title="" /></p>
<div class="rox-info rox-infosmall">
	Note that administrators can hide this ribbon command button from certain Document
	Libraries or library types by customizing the default <a href="?doc=itemref_UploadActions">
		Upload Action</a> under Site Actions / UploadZen Studio / Upload Actions. They
	can also set up multiple, individually configured <i>Upload Actions</i> with different
	settings (such as file type / name extension filters) targeting different libraries
	by type or name.</div>
<p>
	Clicking the <i>Upload Multiple Files</i> button in the ribbon will show the <i>Web
		Uploader</i>:</p>
<p class="rox-docpic">
	<img alt="" border="0" class="rox-docpic" style="height: 444px;" src="help/res/sharepoint-flash-silverlight-bulk-file-upload.png"
		title="" /></p>
<div class="rox-info rox-infosmall">
	If the
	<img class="roxbuttonicon" src="help/res/openfolderHS.png" />
	<i>Add Files</i> link is not visible, then the uploader will most likely display
	a note that &quot;<i>This uploader requires either the Flash 10 browser plug-in (or
		newer) or the Silverlight 4 browser plug-in (or newer)</i>&quot;.
</div>
<h3>Selecting multiple files and uploading them</h3>
<p>
	Clicking the
	<img class="roxbuttonicon" src="help/res/openfolderHS.png" />
	<i>Add Files</i> link shows a file browsing dialog allowing the selection of multiple
	files:
</p>
<p class="rox-docpic">
	<img alt="" border="0" class="rox-docpic" style="height: 444px;" src="help/res/sharepoint-flash-silverlight-select-multiple-files-upload.png"
		title="" /></p>
<div class="rox-info rox-infosmall">
	Administrators can customize <a href="?doc=itemref_UploadActions">Upload Actions</a>
	to offer file type filters in the file browsing dialog box, such as <i>Images (*.jpg;
		*.gif etc)</i> or <i>Archives (*.zip; *.rar etc.)</i>. Offering such file type
	filters (based on file name extensions) at the same time restricts the types of
	files that users may select for upload.
</div>
<p>
	Selecting files adds them to the listing of files to be uploaded:
</p>
<p class="rox-docpic">
	<img alt="" border="0" class="rox-docpic" style="height: 670px;" src="help/res/sharepoint-flash-silverlight-multi-file-batch-upload.png"
		title="" /></p>
<ul class="">
	<li>Files can be de-selected by hovering the row of the file and clicking the
		<img class="roxbuttonicon" src="help/res/deletehs.png" />
		icon in the #number column.</li>
	<li>Files with blocked name extensions are <span style="background-color: #ffbcbc;">
		highlighted in red</span> (but administrators can customize the <a href="?doc=itemref_UploadActions">
			Upload Action</a> to automatically remove such files from the listing when they
		are selected).</li>
	<li>Existing files with the same name are <span style="background-color: #ffefbc;">highlighted
		in yellow</span>, so if end users do not want to overwrite certain existing files,
		they are warned and can remove the file from the listing.</li>
	<li>ZIP archive files can be set to one of the following options:
		<ul>
			<li><b>Upload (don&#39;t extract)</b> &mdash; the ZIP archive file will be uploaded
				as is into the current Library folder</li>
			<li><b>Extract in this folder</b> &mdash; all files and folders in the ZIP archive file
				will be extracted at the server side and be placed into the current Library folder</li>
			<li><b>Extract in a new sub-folder</b> &mdash; all files and folders in the ZIP archive
				file will be extracted at the server side and be placed into a newly created sub-folder
				(inside the current Library folder), which will be named after the original ZIP
				archive file</li>
		</ul>
		All ZIP archive files selected for upload can be set to the same setting by selecting
		that setting for one ZIP archive file, then clicking the
		<img class="roxbuttonicon" src="/_layouts/images/checkall.gif" />
		icon. </li>
	<li>To begin uploading the selected files, end users simply click the
		<img class="roxbuttonicon" src="/_layouts/images/roxority_UploadZen/upload.png" />
		<i>Upload File(s) Now</i> link:</li>
</ul>
<p class="rox-docpic">
	<img alt="" border="0" class="rox-docpic" style="height: 436px;" src="help/res/sharepoint-flash-silverlight-bulk-folder-upload.png"
		title="" /></p>
<p>
	The status column now shows the exact upload progress (or result) for each file and the process can be cancelled at any time by clicking the <img class="roxbuttonicon" src="/_layouts/images/crit_16.gif" /> <i>Cancel All</i> link.
