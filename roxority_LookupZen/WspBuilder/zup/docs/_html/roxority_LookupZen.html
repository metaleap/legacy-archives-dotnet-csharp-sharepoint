<h1>Using LookupZen</h1><h3>
	Why Export SharePoint List Data to CSV?<b style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;" name="s0"></b></h3>
<p>
	CSV stands for "comma-separated values" and is a seasoned, proven, stable and cross-platform
	file format for exchanging data records of identical or similar structure. Most
	advanced, industry-strength software programs can read in and import CSV data files
	easily, including Microsoft Office Excel (for spread sheets) and Outlook (for contacts).
	Utilizing the sophisticated, customizable CSV data export solution provided by LookupZen
	can make your highly custom data transformation or migration processes and tasks
	so much easier and faster to accomplish.</p>
<h3>
	How LookupZen CSV Data Exports work for SharePoint Lists<b style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;" name="s1"></b></h3>
<p>
	LookupZen integrates one or more Export actions into the <i>Actions</i> menu of
	SharePoint List Views:
</p>
<p class="rox-docpic">
	<img alt="" border="0" class="rox-docpic" style="height: 318px;" src="help/res/sharepoint-list-data-export-csv-menu-item.png"
		title="" /></p>
<p>
	Clicking the menu item will let users download the SharePoint List data as a CSV
	file:</p>
<p class="rox-docpic">
	<img alt="" border="0" class="rox-docpic" style="height: 266px;" src="help/res/sharepoint-list-data-export-csv-download.png"
		title="" /></p>
<h3>
	Defining Your Export Action<b style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;" name="s2"></b></h3>
<p>
	To make the above work, you need to tell LookupZen just four things:</p>
<ul>
	<li>the title of the Export menu item,</li>
	<li>the description of the Export menu item,</li>
	<li>the Columns to be included in the exported CSV data file and</li>
	<li>the types of Lists compatible with this export.</li>
</ul>
<p>
	To do so, you just need to create at least one item in an <i>LookupZen Action Definitions</i>
	List, after you have <b style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;" href="">activated</b> the <i>LookupZen Action Definitions
		List</i> Site Collection Feature. While you can create such a List from the
	<i>Create</i> page (available from the <i>Site Actions</i> menu) by clicking <i>LookupZen
		Action Definitions</i> (under the <i>Custom Lists</i> section), note that one
	such List should already exist in your root Web Site, titled <i>LookupZen Action Definitions</i>
	(under the web-relative URL <b>Lists/CsvExportActions</b>) &mdash; check the <i>All
		Site Content</i> page to find that List:
</p>
<p class="rox-docpic">
	<img alt="" border="0" class="rox-docpic" style="height: 388px;" src="help/res/sharepoint-list-data-export-csv-actions.png"
		title="" /></p>
<p>
	In your <i>LookupZen Action Definitions</i> List, simply create and save a new List
	item to finally define your CSV Export action:</p>
<p class="rox-docpic">
	<img alt="" border="0" class="rox-docpic" style="height: 648px;" src="help/res/sharepoint-list-data-export-csv-definition.png"
		title="" /></p>
<p>
	That's it! This CSV Export action you just defined is now available in the <i>Actions</i>
	menu of the specified Lists, and clicking it will download a CSV data file with
	only those columns you specified.
</p>
<div class="rox-info">
	Export actions in <i>LookupZen Action Definitions</i> Lists in a root Web Site are
	available to Lists in all Web Sites across that Site Collection.</div>
<h3>
	Export menu item not showing up? You can also link to your CSV export:<b style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;" name="s3"></b></h3>
<p>
	Your Export action will not show up in the <i>Actions</i> menu of Document Libraries
	and other SharePoint Libraries, and in addition may not show up in List <i>Actions</i>
	menus of heavily customized SharePoint environments. To direct users to a CSV export
	of a given List, simply give them a link to <b>http://your/web/site/url/_layouts/roxority_LookupZen.csv.aspx?exportlist=list_guid</b>
	&mdash; replacing, of course, the <i>your/web/site/url</i> part with your SharePoint
	Web Site URL and the <i>list_guid</i> URL parameter value with the GUID of the List
	to be exported.</p>
<ul>
	<li>If you have more than one export action defined, you can pass a <i>rule</i> 
		URL parameter with the numeric List Item ID of the export action definition to 
		be used.</li>
	<li>If you have more than one <i>Export Action Definitions</i> List, you can specify 
		the one to be used for looking up the applicable export action by passing a <i>
		rulelist</i> URL parameter with the <i>Export Action Definitions</i> List GUID.</li>
</ul>

<h1 style="page-break-before: always;">Solution Installation</h1><h3>
	1. The LookupZen Setup Package<b style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;" name="s0"></b></h3>
<p>
	The <b>LookupZen</b> setup package (the <b style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;" href="http://roxority.com/storage/sharepoint/lookupzen/roxority_LookupZen.zip">
		roxority_LookupZen.zip</b> file) is a zipped archive containing:</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>setup.exe</b> - A graphical user interface (GUI) setup wizard for installing
		and deploying, or retracting and uninstalling <b>LookupZen</b> to and from a SharePoint
		server farm, to be run by an Administrator user on the primary SharePoint farm or
		web front-end server.</li>
	<li><b>docs</b> - A folder containing this product documentation in Microsoft Compiled
		HTML (CHM) and plain HTML formats.</li>
	<li>Additional supporting files that are <i>required</i> for <b>setup.exe</b> to run
		and must neither be modified nor removed.</li>
</ul>
<div class="rox-info">
	Extract the setup package to any file-system folder. Do not just run <b>setup.exe</b>
	directly from inside the setup archive &mdash; it needs to run from a file system
	directory that also contains all the supporting files from the setup archive.</div>
<h3>
	2. Installing the LookupZen Solution Package<b style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;" name="s1"></b></h3>
<p>
	Run <b>setup.exe</b> and when the <i>Welcome</i> screen is displayed, click <i>Next</i>
	to start a series of system checks. To proceed with the installation, all system
	checks need to succeed:</p>
<p class="rox-docpic">
	<img alt="" border="0" class="rox-docpic" style="height: 433px;" src="help/res/setup01.png"
		title="" /></p>
<p>
	Click <i>Next</i> and on the following screen, select the Web Applications to deploy
	<b>LookupZen</b> to. You can also de-select those Site Collections you <i>do not</i>
	want the setup wizard, upon successful deployment, to <i>activate</i> the <i>LookupZen
		Action Definitions List</i> Feature immediately for you on. (Even when <b>LookupZen</b>
	is deployed in a Web Application, before you can add and start using CSV data export
	actions on List View Pages inside a web site, the LookupZen Action Definitions List
	<i>Feature</i> needs to be <i>activated</i> for the parent Site Collection, as described
	in the <i>Feature Activation</i> section below. For now, the setup wizard performs
	these activations for you, depending on your selections.)</p>
<p class="rox-docpic">
	<img alt="" border="0" class="rox-docpic" style="height: 433px;" src="help/res/setup02.png"
		title="" /></p>
<div class="rox-info">
	<b>Note:</b> regardless of your selections, the <b>LookupZen</b> Solution Package
	will always be deployed globally across all Web Applications. Your selections only
	affect in which Site Collections the Setup wizard will activate the <i>LookupZen Action
		Definitions List</i> Feature immediately for you.</div>
<p>
	Click <i>Next</i> to start the installation and wait for the deployment jobs and
	Feature activation to complete. This process can take up to a few minutes.</p>
<p class="rox-docpic">
	<img alt="" border="0" class="rox-docpic" style="height: 433px;" src="help/res/setup03.png"
		title="" /></p>
<p>
	After deployment and Feature activation have completed, review the installation
	log:</p>
<p class="rox-docpic">
	<img alt="" border="0" class="rox-docpic" style="height: 433px;" src="help/res/setup04.png"
		title="" /></p>
<p>
	Once you have successfully completed the setup wizard, you can start using the <b>LookupZen</b>
	<i>LookupZen Action Definitions List</i> on Web Sites inside the previously selected
	Site Collections immediately, as described in the <b style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;" href="intro.html">Using the LookupZen
		CSV Data Export Feature for SharePoint Lists</b> introductory topic.</p>
<p class="rox-docpic">
	<img alt="" border="0" class="rox-docpic" style="height: 433px;" src="help/res/setup05.png"
		title="" /></p>
<h3>
	3. Activating the Site Collection Feature<b style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;" name="s2"></b></h3>
<p>
	The <i>LookupZen Action Definitions List</i> is a <i>SharePoint Site
		Collection-scoped Feature</i>, which needs to be &#39;activated&#39; on each
	Site Collection it is to be used in.</p>
<ol>
	<li>Select <i>Site Settings</i> from the <i>Site Actions</i> menu. </li>
	<li>The <i>Site Settings</i> page contains the <i>Site Collection Administration</i>
		section. In this section, click the <i>Site collection features</i> link. If it
		doesn&#39;t exist, click the <i>Go to top level site settings</i> link in the <i>Site
			Collection Administration</i> section instead, and on the root Web <i>Site Settings</i>
		page now showing, click the <i>Site collection Features</i> link inside the <i>Site
			Collection Administration</i> section. </li>
	<li>The <i>Site Collection Features</i> page should contain a row titled <b>LookupZen
		Action Definitions List</b>. Click the <i>Activate</i> button to make the List available
		inside this site collection; or click the <i>Deactivate</i> button to disable the
		List throughout this site collection.
		<div class="rox-docpic">
			<img alt="" border="0" class="rox-docpic" style="height: 380px;" src="help/res/setup06.png"
				title="" /></div>
	</li>
</ol>
<h1 style="page-break-before: always;">Configuration Settings</h1><p>The following configuration settings are available to administrative users on the <span id="roxconfiglink"><i>Configuration</i> page in your <i>LookupZen Product Center</i>, which you can access by typing a URL like <b>http://my/share/point/_layouts/roxority_LookupZen/default.aspx</b> &mdash; just be sure to replace <i>http://my/share/point</i> with a valid full Site Collection URL pointing to your SharePoint system</span>.</p><p>Each setting has a global value scoped to the SharePoint server farm, and this value can optionally be overridden on the Site Collection level. The following settings are available:</p>
<h3>User Interface Language<b style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;" name="s0"></b></h3>
<p>LookupZen has been localized for multiple languages. Changing this setting affects all user interface artifacts except captions and descriptions of Features, List Templates, Column Types, Content Types or Web Part Templates (those are always loaded directly by SharePoint based on the current Web Site locale).</p>
<p><strong>You can pick one of the following options</strong> on the <i>Configuration</i> page in the <i>LookupZen Product Center</i>:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>(Like site, or English)</em></li>
<li><em>English</em></li>
<li><em>Deutsch</em></li>
</ul>
<h3>Apply UNIX-style escaping<b style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;" name="s1"></b></h3>
<p>By default, LookupZen generates CSV data files using escaping patterns (for critical characters such as commas, line-breaks and quotes) that software written for Windows or Office is more likely to read flawlessly. On the <i>Configuration</i> page in the <i>LookupZen Product Center</i>, tick this check box to generate CSV data files using UNIX-style escaping patterns instead (particularly if you get errors while feeding your exported CSV data files to other, non-Office software).</p>
