<p><b>(Descriptor for a set of SharePoint Web Sites)</b></p><p>Optionally select in which web sites this Export Action will be available. By default, it will be available in all web sites and this usually does not need to be changed during your first explorations within this software.

<h3>ExportZen menu item caption<a name="s3"></a></h3>
<p><b>(Text box)</b></p><p>Specify the caption for this CSV export action to be shown in the export menu item for the Lists specified above. (If you do not specify a caption, the above name for this export action will be used, or if blank, its internal ID.)</p>

<p><b>(Text box)</b></p><p>Specify the description for this CSV export action to be shown in the export menu item for the Lists specified above.</p>

<h3>Export columns<a name="s5"></a></h3>
<p><b>(Text box)</b></p><p>Specify the List Columns (one per line) to include in that order in output CSV data files generated by this export action. (To rename a Column in the exported CSV, enter the List Column name, followed by a colon (:) and the CSV column name.)

<p>Default value for new Export Actions:</p>
<pre>Title</pre>
<h3>Export all item version history in separate column<a name="s6"></a></h3>
<p><b>(Text box)</b></p><p>Optional: if you&#39;d like ExportZen to append an additional column recording all version history per item (only for the Columns specified above, in a simple plain-text format), specify your preferred name for this CSV column here. Leave blank to not append a version history column.<br/><br/>Not applicable to <a target="_blank" href="http://SharePoint-Tools.net/PeopleZen/">User Profile exports via PeopleZen</a>.</p>
<h3>Export item version history in separate rows, one per version<a name="s7"></a></h3>
<p><b>(Check box option)</b></p><p>Instead of keeping all version history in a single column, you can export each version in the history to its own row. These versions will appear underneath the data item row, in descending sort order, and in this case you&#39;ll need a separate CSV column to denote the version number of each history record. You <b>need</b> to enter this CSV column name (for example &#39;Version&#39;) above this check-box option if ticked.<br/><br/>Not applicable to <a target="_blank" href="http://SharePoint-Tools.net/PeopleZen/">User Profile exports via PeopleZen</a>.</p>
<h3>Export current View<a name="s8"></a></h3>
<p><b>(Check box option)</b></p><p>If ticked, this export action only ever exports items included in the currently displayed List View, applying the View-defined default sort orders and filters (but <b>not</b> currently user-applied live sort order, filters or paging); otherwise, all List items are exported, unfiltered and in their original sort order.<br/><br/>Not applicable to <a target="_blank" href="http://SharePoint-Tools.net/PeopleZen/">User Profile exports via PeopleZen</a>.</p>
<h3>Ignore paging in PeopleZen exports<a name="s9"></a></h3>
<p><b>(Check box option)</b></p><p>Even if the PeopleZen Web Part to be exported is paged, if this check-box option is ticked then all user profiles belonging to the Web Part are exported, instead of just those included in the currently shown page.</p>
<h3>Respect currently applied filters (FilterZen only)<a name="s10"></a></h3>
<p><b>(Check box option)</b></p><p>If ticked, this export action only ever exports items included in the filtering currently applied to the applicable List View (<b>only</b> supports filters supplied by a currently connected <a target="_blank" href="http://roxority.com/filterzen/">FilterZen Filter Web Part</a>).</p>
</span><h4 class="rox-h4 rox-doctab rox-doctab-f"><a href="#" onclick="roxTogDocTab('f');">&quot;Formatting Options&quot; tab:</a></h4><span class="rox-doctab rox-doctab-f">
<h3>Use semicolons instead of commas<a name="s11"></a></h3>
<p><b>(Check box option)</b></p><p>Not recommended unless you and your users intend to only ever open these CSV exports in Microsoft Office Excel <b>AND</b> Excel displays all comma-separated column values in a single cell (some internationalized Excel versions do that, some don&#39;t).</p>
<h3>Apply UNIX-style escaping<a name="s12"></a></h3>
<p><b>(Check box option)</b></p><p>If un-ticked, ExportZen generates CSV data files using escaping patterns (for critical characters such as commas, line-breaks and quotes) that software written for Windows or Office is more likely to read flawlessly. Tick this check box to generate CSV data files using UNIX-style escaping patterns instead (only recommended if you get errors while feeding your exported CSV data files to other, non-Office software).</p>
<h3>Export locale<a name="s13"></a></h3>
<p><b>(Culture picker)</b></p><p>This setting controls how numbers and dates are represented in this export. For example, dates may be stored in an US format (due to your SharePoint installation) but your export consumers may use a different-locale version of Excel (such as for example German), which would then mis-read and mis-represent factually-correct, but US-formatted date values. Keep the default choice to start with and experiment as needed if results do not meet expectations.</p>
<p>The drop-down menu provides all standard-defined regions. You can also choose from the following "dynamic" cultures:
</p><ul>
<li>Server-side &#39;current&#39; locale &mdash; the culture currently set to use by default for the Windows and/or ASP.NET installation on the server</li>
<li>Web site locale &mdash; the culture selected under Site Settings / Regional Settings</li>
<li>User account locale &mdash; the culture selected for the current end user account unter My Settings / Regional Settings</li>
<li>Server-side installation locale &mdash; the culture of the Windows installation on the server</li>
<li>User agent (browser) locale &mdash; the browser-supplied &#39;preferred culture&#39; hint</li>
</ul>
<p>The default choice is: <i>Server-side &#39;current&#39; locale</i>.</p>
<h3>Export encoding<a name="s14"></a></h3>
<p><b>(Encoding picker)</b></p><p>Only if your exports contain international characters that don&#39;t look as expected in external software importing this export should you start experimenting with different export encodings. The Unicode / UTF encodings are the recommended choices to test before trying other encodings. Keep this set to Default <b>UNLESS</b> your exported contents are not decoded correctly by external software that needs to consume this export in production.</p>
<p>The drop-down menu provides all standard-defined text encodings. The default choice is: <i>Server-side default encoding</i>, meaning the default encoding defined for the Windows and/or ASP.NET installation on the server.</p>
<h3>Prepend UTF-8 byte order mark<a name="s15"></a></h3>
<p><b>(Check box option)</b></p><p><b>ONLY</b> tick this option if you selected the UTF-8 encoding above <b>AND</b> your exported contents are not decoded correctly by the external software that needs to consume this export in production. Recommended for opening UTF-8 exports in Excel.</p>
