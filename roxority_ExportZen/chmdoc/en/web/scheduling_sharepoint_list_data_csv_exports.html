	In a future release, ExportZen will offer a full-fledged SharePoint Timer Job integrated
	into Central Administration for scheduling automated CSV List data exports. Even
	in the current release however, the software provides a fully workable way for you
	to start automating and scheduling exports immediately. This involves only a few
	setup steps outlined in this topic.</p>
<h3>
	Running exports on Windows Server, outside of SharePoint:<a name="s0"></a></h3>
<p>
	When you successfully <a href="setup">deployed ExportZen to your SharePoint environment</a>,
	an executable file <strong>ExportZen.exe</strong> also got deployed to the file
	systems of your farm servers. The setup wizard (more specifically, the ExportZen
	WSP solution package) placed this executable in your &quot;14 hive&quot; (or your
	&quot;12 hive&quot; on SharePoint 2007), ie. the full executable path is most likely
	<strong>C:\Program Files\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\Web Server Extensions\14\TEMPLATE\LAYOUTS\roxority_ExportZen\ExportZen.exe</strong>
	(or a localized equivalent path).</p>

<p>
	Once you have <a href="?doc=intro#s2">defined a CSV export action</a>, this action
	can also be invoked by the above command-line program. It takes three arguments:</p>
<ol>
	<li>The first argument needs to be &quot;quoted&quot; and specifies the full URL of
		the List or Document Library to be exported: for example &quot;<i>http://our-sharepoint/projects/Lists/Tasks</i>&quot;.</li>
	<li>The second argument needs to be &quot;quoted&quot; and specifies the name or ID
		of your export action. You likely provided the name yourself initially when the
		export action was set up, if unsure simply look it up on the <a href="itemref_ExportActions">
			Export Actions page</a>.</li>
	<li>The third argument is also specified in quotation marks and specifies the full path
		of the exported .CSV file, to be stored directly in the SharePoint web front-end
		server file system.</li>
</ol>
<p>
	Of course, you&#39;ll need to run <i>ExportZen.exe</i> at all times:</p>
<ul>
	<li>with no more and no less than those three arguments, and</li>
	<li>under a user account with read access to the List, read access to the <i>14 hive</i>
		(or <i>12 hive</i>) and write access to the specified file system location.</li>
</ul>
<p>
	However, other than that you may invoke the tool in any way you wish, and do with
	its output file as you please.</p>
<h3>
	Use built-in Windows Server features for scheduling:<a name="s1"></a></h3>
<p>
	Once you have experimentally and interactively tested that your export also works
	with the <i>ExportZen.exe</i> command-line utility too, you can schedule your exports
	using just the <i>Task Scheduler</i> that&#39;s part of Windows Server. (Naturally,
	the <i>Task Scheduler</i> service needs to auto-run for this.)

<p>
	Apart from setting
	the path and arguments to <i>ExportZen.exe</i> as described in the above paragraph,
	you should make sure the task:</p>
<ul>
	<li>will run under the appropriate user account,</li>
	<li>is set to run regardless of whether that user is logged on interactively or not,
		and</li>
	<li>of course, has your desired schedule applied.</li>
</ul>
