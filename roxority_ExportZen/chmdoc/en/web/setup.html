<h3>
	1. The ExportZen Setup Package<a name="s0"></a></h3>
<p>
	The ExportZen setup package (the <a href="http://roxority.s3.amazonaws.com/roxority_ExportZen.zip">
		roxority_ExportZen.zip</a> file) is a zipped archive containing:</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Deploy.exe</b> &mdash; a graphical user interface (GUI) setup wizard for installing
		and deploying, or retracting and uninstalling ExportZen to and from a SharePoint
		server farm, <b>to be run by a farm administrator user</b> on the &quot;primary&quot;
		SharePoint farm or web front-end server &mdash; in a multi-server farm environment,
		that is the server hosting <i>Central Administration</i>.</li>
	<li><b>docs</b> &mdash; a folder containing this product documentation in Microsoft
		Compiled HTML (CHM) and plain HTML formats.</li>
	<li><b>LegacyMigration.exe</b> &mdash; a graphical user interface (GUI) tool needed
		<i>only</i> when you intend to install ExportZen 1.6 or higher on a SharePoint server
		farm that any point had, or still has version 1.5 or lower installed. You will be
		notified by <b>Deploy.exe</b> if you need to run the <a href="#s3">LegacyMigration.exe
			tool</a>.</li>
	<li>Additional supporting files that are <i>required</i> for <b>Deploy.exe</b> to run
		and must neither be modified nor removed.</li>
</ul>
<h3>
	2. Installing the ExportZen Solution Package<a name="s1"></a></h3>
<p>
	Run <b>Deploy.exe</b> (under user account credentials added to the <i>Farm Administrators</i>
	group in <i>Central Administration</i>, on the &quot;primary&quot; SharePoint farm
	or web front-end server &mdash; in a multi-server farm environment, that is the
	server hosting <i>Central Administration</i>) and when the <i>Welcome</i> screen
	is displayed, click <i>Next</i> to start a series of system checks. To proceed with
	the installation, all system checks need to succeed:</p>

	<img alt="" border="0" class="rox-docpic" style="height: 433px;" src="/storage/images/roxority_ExportZen/setup01.png"
		title="" /></p>
<p>
	Click <i>Next</i> and on the following screen, select the Web Applications to deploy
	ExportZen to. You can also de-select those Site Collections you <i>do not</i> want
	the setup wizard, upon successful deployment, to <i>activate</i> the <a href="#s2">ExportZen
		List Integration</a> feature immediately for you on.</p>
<p class="rox-docpic">
	<img alt="" border="0" class="rox-docpic" style="height: 433px;" src="/storage/images/roxority_ExportZen/setup02.png"
		title="" /></p>
<div class="rox-info">
	<b>Note:</b> even when ExportZen is deployed in a Web Application, before you can
	offer your Export Actions to Lists a web site, the <b>ExportZen List Integration</b>
	<i>Feature</i> needs to be <i>activated</i> for the parent Site Collection, as described
	in the <i>Feature Activation</i> section below. For now, the setup wizard performs
	these activations for you, depending on your selections.</div>
<p>
	Click <i>Next</i> to start the installation and wait for the deployment jobs and
	Feature activation to complete. This process can take up to a few minutes.</p>
<p class="rox-docpic">
	<img alt="" border="0" class="rox-docpic" style="height: 433px;" src="/storage/images/roxority_ExportZen/setup03.png"

<p>
	After deployment and Feature activation have completed, review the installation
	log:</p>

<p>
	Once you have successfully completed the setup wizard, you can start defining <i>Export
		Actions</i> (via Site Settings / ExportZen Studio) immediately, as described
	in the <a href="intro">Using the ExportZen CSV Data Export Feature for SharePoint
		Lists</a> introductory topic.</p>

<h3>
	3. Activating the Site Collection Feature<a name="s2"></a></h3>
<p>
	The <b>ExportZen List Integration</b> feature is a <i>SharePoint Site Collection-scoped
		Feature</i>, which needs to be &#39;activated&#39; on each Site Collection it
	is to be used in.</p>
<p>
	This feature needs to be activated if your Export Actions (defined under Site Settings
	/ ExportZen Studio) should be offered to end users (via the &quot;Actions&quot;
	List toolbar menu and the &quot;Connect and Export&quot; ribbon group) to facilitate
	interactive invokation of your Export Actions.
</p>
<ol>
	<li>Select <i>Site Settings</i> from the <i>Site Actions</i> menu. </li>
	<li>The <i>Site Settings</i> page contains the <i>Site Collection Administration</i>
		section. In this section, click the <i>Site collection features</i> link. If it
		doesn&#39;t exist, click the <i>Go to top level site settings</i> link in the <i>Site
			Collection Administration</i> section instead, and on the root Web <i>Site Settings</i>
		page now showing, click the <i>Site collection Features</i> link inside the <i>Site
			Collection Administration</i> section. </li>
	<li>The <i>Site Collection Features</i> page (<b>not</b> the <i>Site Features</i> page!) should contain a row titled <b>ExportZen
		List Integration</b>.
		<ul>
			<li>If it <b>does</b>, click the <i>Activate</i> button to make so-configured Export
				Actions available to end users via the SharePoint List menus and ribbons inside
				this Site Collection; or click the <i>Deactivate</i> button to disable the ExportZen
				menus throughout this Site Collection.

						title="" /></div>
			</li>
			<li>If the row <b>doesn&#39;t</b> exist, the <b>ExportZen</b> solution package was not
				yet deployed to this web application. On the <i>System Settings</i> page (<i>Operations</i>
				in SharePoint 2007) in the <i>Central Administration</i>, click <i>Manage Farm Solutions</i>
				(<i>Solution management</i> in SharePoint 2007). On the <i>Solution Management</i>
				page, click <b>roxority_exportzen_xyz.wsp</b> (the <i>xyz</i> part will be different
				depending on your SharePoint version) to open the <i>Solution Properties</i> page.
				Click <i>Deploy Solution</i>, then select this Site Collection&#39;s parent web
				application and click <i>OK</i>. (The deployment is delegated to a background job
				scheduled to run either at the date and time specified, or as soon as possible.
				Once started, it may take this job up to a few minutes to finish deployment.)

<h3>
	4. Upgrading from ExportZen 1.5 or lower to 1.6 or higher<a name="s3"></a></h3>
<p>
	The <b>LegacyMigration.exe</b> tool is needed if you intend to upgrade ExportZen
	from a previously or currently installed version lower than 1.6, to 1.6 or higher.
	<b>Deploy.exe</b> will detect whether the tool needs to be run in your environment,
	and inform you accordingly.
</p>
<p>
	If this upgrade scenario applies to you and you haven&#39;t uninstalled ExportZen
	yet, <b>good &mdash; don&#39;t</b> do so until you have completed this tool successfully.
</p>
<p>
	Prior to 1.6, ExportZen used its own List definition and custom field types so that
	ExportZen action definitions could be set up by admins and power users. Starting
	in 1.6, this overhead is no longer necessary, but keeping Lists and their Columns
	based on these legacy types in your content database WOULD compromise your SharePoint
	environment after upgrading to 1.6 because the underlying List definitions and Column
	types are no longer there.
</p>
<p>
	It is therefore <b>crucial</b> to not just recycle but fully delete these legacy
	Lists. The <b>LegacyMigration.exe</b> tool first scans your entire SharePoint server
	farm for these legacy Lists when you click the scan button on the left. This first
	step is definitely completely harmless.
</p>
<p>
	After the scan completes, all legacy Lists found are shown in the view on the left.
	Click the Backup/Export button on the right to first save all your export action
	definitions from your earlier installation to a file that you will be able to fully
	import (via Site Settings / ExportZen Studio / Transfer Wizard) into ExportZen 1.6
	or higher later after the upgrade has been performed. This button will then attempt
	to delete all legacy Lists found, and will notify you about its success. All these
	legacy Lists will need to be deleted or the ExportZen deployment wizard (Deploy.exe)
	will simply refuse to perform the upgrade to 1.6 or higher.
