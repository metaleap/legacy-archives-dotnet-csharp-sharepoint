<h1>CSV Data Exports for SharePoint Lists</h1><h3>
	Why Export SharePoint List Data to CSV?<b style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;" name="s0"></b></h3>
<p>
	CSV stands for "comma-separated values" and is a seasoned, proven, stable and cross-platform
	file format for exchanging data records of identical or similar structure. Most
	advanced, industry-strength software systems can read in and import CSV data files
	easily, including Microsoft Office Excel (for spread sheets) and Outlook (for contacts).
	Utilizing the sophisticated, customizable CSV data export solution provided by ExportZen
	can make your highly custom data transformation or migration processes and tasks
	so much easier and faster to accomplish.</p>
<h3>
	How ExportZen CSV Data Exports work for SharePoint Lists<b style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;" name="s1"></b></h3>
<p>
	In <b>SharePoint 2007</b> (WSS 3.0 and MOSS 2007) ExportZen integrates one or more
	Export actions into the <i>Actions</i> menu of SharePoint List Views:
</p>
<p class="rox-docpic">
	<img alt="" border="0" class="rox-docpic" style="height: 318px;" src="help/res/sharepoint-list-data-export-csv-menu-item.png"
		title="" /></p>
<p>
	In <b>SharePoint 2010</b> (Foundation and Server) ExportZen integrates one or more
	Export commands into its own <i>Export to CSV</i> menu inside the <i>Connect &amp; Export</i>
	section of the <i>List</i> ribbon tab:
</p>
<p class="rox-docpic">
	<img alt="" border="0" class="rox-docpic" style="height: 140px;" src="help/res/csv-list-export-ribbon.png"
		title="" /></p>
<p>
	Clicking the menu item will let users download the SharePoint List data as a CSV
	file:</p>
<p class="rox-docpic">
	<img alt="" border="0" class="rox-docpic" style="height: 266px;" src="help/res/sharepoint-list-data-export-csv-download.png"
		title="" /></p>
<p>
	In addition to making CSV exports available interactively to end users as illustrated
	above, you can also utilize the same ExportZen capabilities for <b style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;" href="scheduling_sharepoint_list_data_csv_exports.html">
		scheduled automation of server-side, unsupervised, background List data exports</b>.</p>
<h3>
	Defining Your Export Action<b style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;" name="s2"></b></h3>
<p>
	To make the above work, you need to tell ExportZen just a few preferences, by specifying
	for a given export use case (which can then be re-invoked time and again) some so-called
	<b style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;" href="itemref_ExportActions.html">Export Action Definition Settings</b>, such
	as:</p>
<ul>
	<li>the title of the Export menu item,</li>
	<li>the description of the Export menu item (optional),</li>
	<li>the Columns to be included in the exported CSV data file and</li>
	<li>the types of Lists (or the name of the List) compatible with this export and <b style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;" 		href="itemref_ExportActions.html">various other settings</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>
	To do so, you just need to create at least one rule on the <i>Export Actions</i>
	page available via Site Settings / ExportZen Studio / Export Actions:
</p>
<p class="rox-docpic">
	<img alt="" border="0" class="rox-docpic" style="height: 388px;" src="help/res/sharepoint-list-data-export-csv-actions.png"
		title="" /></p>
<p>
	On the <i>Export Actions</i> page, simply create and save a new rule item to finally
	define your CSV Export action:</p>
<p class="rox-docpic">
	<img alt="" border="0" class="rox-docpic" style="height: 898px;" src="help/res/sharepoint-list-data-export-csv-definition.png"
		title="" /></p>
<p>
	That&#39;s it! This CSV Export action you just defined is now available in the <i>Actions</i>
	menu of the specified Lists, and clicking it will download a CSV data file with
	only those columns you specified, fully reflecting all of your <b style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;" href="itemref_ExportActions.html">
		export action definition settings</b>.
</p>
<h3>
	Export menu item not showing up? You can also link to your CSV export:<b style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;" name="s3"></b></h3>
<p>
	Your Export action may not show up in the <i>Actions</i> menu of SharePoint 2007
	Document Libraries and other SharePoint 2007 Libraries, and in addition may not
	show up in List <i>Actions</i> menus of heavily customized SharePoint 2007 environments.
	(Such incidents have so far not yet been observed under SharePoint 2010 however.)
	To direct users to a CSV export of a given List, simply give them a link to <b>http://your/web/site/url/_layouts/roxority_ExportZen/expo.aspx?exportlist=list_guid&amp;rule=youraction</b>
	&mdash; replacing, of course, the <i>your/web/site/url</i> part with your SharePoint
	Web Site URL, the <i>list_guid</i> URL parameter value with the GUID of the List
	to be exported and the <i>youraction</i> URL parameter value with the name of your
	export action.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before: always;">Solution Installation</h1><h3>
	1. The ExportZen Setup Package<b style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;" name="s0"></b></h3>
<p>
	The ExportZen setup package (the <b style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;" href="http://roxority.s3.amazonaws.com/roxority_ExportZen.zip">
		roxority_ExportZen.zip</b> file) is a zipped archive containing:</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Deploy.exe</b> &mdash; a graphical user interface (GUI) setup wizard for installing
		and deploying, or retracting and uninstalling ExportZen to and from a SharePoint
		server farm, <b>to be run by a farm administrator user</b> on the &quot;primary&quot;
		SharePoint farm or web front-end server &mdash; in a multi-server farm environment,
		that is the server hosting <i>Central Administration</i>.</li>
	<li><b>docs</b> &mdash; a folder containing this product documentation in Microsoft
		Compiled HTML (CHM) and plain HTML formats.</li>
	<li><b>LegacyMigration.exe</b> &mdash; a graphical user interface (GUI) tool needed
		<i>only</i> when you intend to install ExportZen 1.6 or higher on a SharePoint server
		farm that any point had, or still has version 1.5 or lower installed. You will be
		notified by <b>Deploy.exe</b> if you need to run the <b style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;" href="#s3">LegacyMigration.exe
			tool</b>.</li>
	<li>Additional supporting files that are <i>required</i> for <b>Deploy.exe</b> to run
		and must neither be modified nor removed.</li>
</ul>
<h3>
	2. Installing the ExportZen Solution Package<b style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;" name="s1"></b></h3>
<p>
	Run <b>Deploy.exe</b> (under user account credentials added to the <i>Farm Administrators</i>
	group in <i>Central Administration</i>, on the &quot;primary&quot; SharePoint farm
	or web front-end server &mdash; in a multi-server farm environment, that is the
	server hosting <i>Central Administration</i>) and when the <i>Welcome</i> screen
	is displayed, click <i>Next</i> to start a series of system checks. To proceed with
	the installation, all system checks need to succeed:</p>
<p class="rox-docpic">
	<img alt="" border="0" class="rox-docpic" style="height: 433px;" src="help/res/setup01.png"
		title="" /></p>
<p>
	Click <i>Next</i> and on the following screen, select the Web Applications to deploy
	ExportZen to. You can also de-select those Site Collections you <i>do not</i> want
	the setup wizard, upon successful deployment, to <i>activate</i> the <b style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;" href="#s2">ExportZen
		List Integration</b> feature immediately for you on.</p>
<p class="rox-docpic">
	<img alt="" border="0" class="rox-docpic" style="height: 433px;" src="help/res/setup02.png"
		title="" /></p>
<div class="rox-info">
	<b>Note:</b> even when ExportZen is deployed in a Web Application, before you can
	offer your Export Actions to Lists a web site, the <b>ExportZen List Integration</b>
	<i>Feature</i> needs to be <i>activated</i> for the parent Site Collection, as described
	in the <i>Feature Activation</i> section below. For now, the setup wizard performs
	these activations for you, depending on your selections.</div>
<p>
	Click <i>Next</i> to start the installation and wait for the deployment jobs and
	Feature activation to complete. This process can take up to a few minutes.</p>
<p class="rox-docpic">
	<img alt="" border="0" class="rox-docpic" style="height: 433px;" src="help/res/setup03.png"
		title="" /></p>
<p>
	After deployment and Feature activation have completed, review the installation
	log:</p>
<p class="rox-docpic">
	<img alt="" border="0" class="rox-docpic" style="height: 433px;" src="help/res/setup04.png"
		title="" /></p>
<p>
	Once you have successfully completed the setup wizard, you can start defining <i>Export
		Actions</i> (via Site Settings / ExportZen Studio) immediately, as described
	in the <b style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;" href="intro.html">Using the ExportZen CSV Data Export Feature for SharePoint
		Lists</b> introductory topic.</p>

<h3>
	3. Activating the Site Collection Feature<b style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;" name="s2"></b></h3>
<p>
	The <b>ExportZen List Integration</b> feature is a <i>SharePoint Site Collection-scoped
		Feature</i>, which needs to be &#39;activated&#39; on each Site Collection it
	is to be used in.</p>
<p>
	This feature needs to be activated if your Export Actions (defined under Site Settings
	/ ExportZen Studio) should be offered to end users (via the &quot;Actions&quot;
	List toolbar menu and the &quot;Connect and Export&quot; ribbon group) to facilitate
	interactive invokation of your Export Actions.
</p>
<ol>
	<li>Select <i>Site Settings</i> from the <i>Site Actions</i> menu. </li>
	<li>The <i>Site Settings</i> page contains the <i>Site Collection Administration</i>
		section. In this section, click the <i>Site collection features</i> link. If it
		doesn&#39;t exist, click the <i>Go to top level site settings</i> link in the <i>Site
			Collection Administration</i> section instead, and on the root Web <i>Site Settings</i>
		page now showing, click the <i>Site collection Features</i> link inside the <i>Site
			Collection Administration</i> section. </li>
	<li>The <i>Site Collection Features</i> page (<b>not</b> the <i>Site Features</i> page!) should contain a row titled <b>ExportZen
		List Integration</b>.
		<ul>
			<li>If it <b>does</b>, click the <i>Activate</i> button to make so-configured Export
				Actions available to end users via the SharePoint List menus and ribbons inside
				this Site Collection; or click the <i>Deactivate</i> button to disable the ExportZen
				menus throughout this Site Collection.
				<div class="rox-docpic">
					<img alt="" border="0" class="rox-docpic" style="height: 380px;" src="help/res/setup06.png"
						title="" /></div>
			</li>
			<li>If the row <b>doesn&#39;t</b> exist, the <b>ExportZen</b> solution package was not
				yet deployed to this web application. On the <i>System Settings</i> page (<i>Operations</i>
				in SharePoint 2007) in the <i>Central Administration</i>, click <i>Manage Farm Solutions</i>
				(<i>Solution management</i> in SharePoint 2007). On the <i>Solution Management</i>
				page, click <b>roxority_exportzen_xyz.wsp</b> (the <i>xyz</i> part will be different
				depending on your SharePoint version) to open the <i>Solution Properties</i> page.
				Click <i>Deploy Solution</i>, then select this Site Collection&#39;s parent web
				application and click <i>OK</i>. (The deployment is delegated to a background job
				scheduled to run either at the date and time specified, or as soon as possible.
				Once started, it may take this job up to a few minutes to finish deployment.)

<h3>
	4. Upgrading from ExportZen 1.5 or lower to 1.6 or higher<b style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;" name="s3"></b></h3>
<p>
	The <b>LegacyMigration.exe</b> tool is needed if you intend to upgrade ExportZen
	from a previously or currently installed version lower than 1.6, to 1.6 or higher.
	<b>Deploy.exe</b> will detect whether the tool needs to be run in your environment,
	and inform you accordingly.
</p>
<p>
	If this upgrade scenario applies to you and you haven&#39;t uninstalled ExportZen
	yet, <b>good &mdash; don&#39;t</b> do so until you have completed this tool successfully.
</p>
<p>
	Prior to 1.6, ExportZen used its own List definition and custom field types so that
	ExportZen action definitions could be set up by admins and power users. Starting
	in 1.6, this overhead is no longer necessary, but keeping Lists and their Columns
	based on these legacy types in your content database WOULD compromise your SharePoint
	environment after upgrading to 1.6 because the underlying List definitions and Column
	types are no longer there.
</p>
<p>
	It is therefore <b>crucial</b> to not just recycle but fully delete these legacy
	Lists. The <b>LegacyMigration.exe</b> tool first scans your entire SharePoint server
	farm for these legacy Lists when you click the scan button on the left. This first
	step is definitely completely harmless.
</p>
<p>
	After the scan completes, all legacy Lists found are shown in the view on the left.
	Click the Backup/Export button on the right to first save all your export action
	definitions from your earlier installation to a file that you will be able to fully
	import (via Site Settings / ExportZen Studio / Transfer Wizard) into ExportZen 1.6
	or higher later after the upgrade has been performed. This button will then attempt
	to delete all legacy Lists found, and will notify you about its success. All these
	legacy Lists will need to be deleted or the ExportZen deployment wizard (Deploy.exe)
	will simply refuse to perform the upgrade to 1.6 or higher.

<h1 style="page-break-before: always;">Scheduled Automatic Background Exports</h1><p>
	In a future release, ExportZen will offer a full-fledged SharePoint Timer Job integrated
	into Central Administration for scheduling automated CSV List data exports. Even
	in the current release however, the software provides a fully workable way for you
	to start automating and scheduling exports immediately. This involves only a few
	setup steps outlined in this topic.</p>
<h3>
	Running exports on Windows Server, outside of SharePoint:<b style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;" name="s0"></b></h3>
<p>
	When you successfully <b style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;" href="setup.html">deployed ExportZen to your SharePoint environment</b>,
	an executable file <strong>ExportZen.exe</strong> also got deployed to the file
	systems of your farm servers. The setup wizard (more specifically, the ExportZen
	WSP solution package) placed this executable in your &quot;14 hive&quot; (or your
	&quot;12 hive&quot; on SharePoint 2007), ie. the full executable path is most likely
	<strong>C:\Program Files\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\Web Server Extensions\14\TEMPLATE\LAYOUTS\roxority_ExportZen\ExportZen.exe</strong>
	(or a localized equivalent path).</p>

	<img alt="" border="0" class="rox-docpic" style="height: 477px;" src="help/res/sharepoint-export-12-hive-14.png"
		title="" /></p>
<p>
	Once you have <b style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;" href="?doc=intro#s2">defined a CSV export action</b>, this action
	can also be invoked by the above command-line program. It takes three arguments:</p>
<ol>
	<li>The first argument needs to be &quot;quoted&quot; and specifies the full URL of
		the List or Document Library to be exported: for example &quot;<i>http://our-sharepoint/projects/Lists/Tasks</i>&quot;.</li>
	<li>The second argument needs to be &quot;quoted&quot; and specifies the name or ID
		of your export action. You likely provided the name yourself initially when the
		export action was set up, if unsure simply look it up on the <b style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;" href="itemref_ExportActions.html">
			Export Actions page</b>.</li>
	<li>The third argument is also specified in quotation marks and specifies the full path
		of the exported .CSV file, to be stored directly in the SharePoint web front-end
		server file system.</li>
</ol>
<p>
	Of course, you&#39;ll need to run <i>ExportZen.exe</i> at all times:</p>
<ul>
	<li>with no more and no less than those three arguments, and</li>
	<li>under a user account with read access to the List, read access to the <i>14 hive</i>
		(or <i>12 hive</i>) and write access to the specified file system location.</li>
</ul>
<p>
	However, other than that you may invoke the tool in any way you wish, and do with
	its output file as you please.</p>
<h3>
	Use built-in Windows Server features for scheduling:<b style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;" name="s1"></b></h3>
<p>
	Once you have experimentally and interactively tested that your export also works
	with the <i>ExportZen.exe</i> command-line utility too, you can schedule your exports
	using just the <i>Task Scheduler</i> that&#39;s part of Windows Server. (Naturally,
	the <i>Task Scheduler</i> service needs to auto-run for this.)
</p>
<p class="rox-docpic">
	<img alt="" border="0" class="rox-docpic" style="height: 321px;" src="help/res/sharepoint-export-timer-job.png"
		title="" /></p>
<p>
	Apart from setting
	the path and arguments to <i>ExportZen.exe</i> as described in the above paragraph,
	you should make sure the task:</p>
<ul>
	<li>will run under the appropriate user account,</li>
	<li>is set to run regardless of whether that user is logged on interactively or not,
		and</li>
	<li>of course, has your desired schedule applied.</li>
</ul>

<h1 style="page-break-before: always;">Configuration Settings</h1><p>The following configuration settings are available to administrative users on the <span id="roxconfiglink"><i>Configuration</i> page in your <i>ExportZen Studio</i>, which you can access via Site Settings / ExportZen Studio / Configuration Settings</span>.</p><p>Each setting has a global value scoped to the SharePoint server farm, and this value can optionally be overridden on the Site Collection level. The following settings are available:</p>
<h3>User Interface Language<b style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;" name="s0"></b></h3>
<p>ExportZen has been localized for multiple languages. In addition to English and German, if you have added partial translations in other languages (via Site Settings / ExportZen Studio / DIY User Interface Localization), these languages will be available for selection here. Changing this setting affects all ExportZen user interfaces except captions and descriptions of Features, List Templates, Column Types, Content Types or Web Part Templates (those are always loaded directly by SharePoint based on the current Web Site locale).</p>
<p><strong>You can pick one of the following options</strong> on the <i>Configuration</i> page in the <i>ExportZen Studio</i>:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>(Like site, or English)</i></li>
<li><i>English</i></li>
<li><i>Deutsch</i></li>
</ul>
<h3>Hide (2007) or disable (2010) SharePoint&#39;s out-of-box &quot;Export to Excel&quot; command<b style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;" name="s1"></b></h3>
<p>By default, your ExportZen action commands co-exist together with the built-in, out-of-box &#39;Export to Excel&#39; command. If you intend to fully replace that functionality with ExportZen, you can set whether and when to show (2007) / enable (2010) the built-in, out-of-box &#39;Export to Excel&#39; command (affects both both the SharePoint 2007 List Actions tool-bar menu item and the ribbon button in the SharePoint 2010 &#39;Connect and Export&#39; section of the List Tools ribbon tab).</p>
<p><strong>You can pick one of the following options</strong> on the <i>Configuration</i> page in the <i>ExportZen Studio</i>:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Never</i></li>
<li><i>Only if CSV export actions exist (requires activated Site Collection feature)</i></li>
<li><i>Always (requires activated Site Collection feature)</i></li>
</ul>
<h3>Separator for exported multi-valued Column data<b style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;" name="s2"></b></h3>
<p>This specifies the text used to combine the export value representations of List Columns containing multiple values, such as multi-Choice and multi-Lookup Columns.</p>
<p>After you have customized this setting, you can click the <b>Reset to Default Value</b> link on the <i>Configuration</i> page in the <i>ExportZen Studio</i> to restore the following default value:</p>
<pre>, </pre>
<h3>No default instances of ExportZen configurables on the Site Collection level (NOT recommended!)<b style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;" name="s3"></b></h3>
<p>Configurables are lists of items for defining and customizing the behaviors of this software (such as Export Actions in ExportZen, Data Sources and Data Field Templates in PeopleZen, Print Views and Print Launchers in PrintZen, Upload Actions in UploadZen). By default, each Site Collection has its own non-removable default instance that can be customized and to which additional instances can be added. In extensive farm setups (1000s of Site Collections), these default instances may be a hindrance and using only custom farm-level instances may be preferable. Tick this option to never provide the default instance on the Site Collection level.</p>
<h3>By default, no inclusion of jQuery library (NOT recommended)<b style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;" name="s4"></b></h3>
<p>Some ExportZen end user-facing artifacts require (and load into the respective host pages) the jQuery library. Embedding jQuery more than once in a single page can cause JavaScript warnings in Internet Explorer with <i>some few</i> jQuery plugins (and only if any are used in your farm at all). On the <i>Configuration</i> page in the <i>ExportZen Studio</i>, tick this check box <i>only</i> if your master pages, web pages or third-party extensions also already include jQuery globally (not just on some individual pages) and independently of ExportZen to prevent ExportZen from loading jQuery too. If you do so, you need to make sure jQuery is loaded on each page hosting also hosting ExportZen user interface artifacts, or ExportZen will appear broken. This is a global default setting that can be optionally overridden locally where applicable.</p>
