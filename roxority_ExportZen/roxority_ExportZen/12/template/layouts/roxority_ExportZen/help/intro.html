<h3>
	Why Export SharePoint List Data to CSV?</h3>
<p>
	CSV stands for "comma-separated values" and is a seasoned, proven, stable and cross-platform
	file format for exchanging data records of identical or similar structure. Most
	advanced, industry-strength software systems can read in and import CSV data files
	easily, including Microsoft Office Excel (for spread sheets) and Outlook (for contacts).
	Utilizing the sophisticated, customizable CSV data export solution provided by ExportZen
	can make your highly custom data transformation or migration processes and tasks
	so much easier and faster to accomplish.</p>
<h3>
	How ExportZen CSV Data Exports work for SharePoint Lists</h3>
<p>
	In <b>SharePoint 2007</b> (WSS 3.0 and MOSS 2007) ExportZen integrates one or more
	Export actions into the <i>Actions</i> menu of SharePoint List Views:
</p>
<p class="rox-docpic">
	<img alt="" border="0" class="rox-docpic" style="height: 318px;" src="help/res/sharepoint-list-data-export-csv-menu-item.png"
		title="" /></p>
<p>
	In <b>SharePoint 2013 and 2010</b> (Foundation and Server) ExportZen integrates one or more
	Export commands into its own <i>Export to CSV</i> menu inside the <i>Connect &amp; Export</i>
	section of the <i>List</i> ribbon tab:
</p>
<p class="rox-docpic">
	<img alt="" border="0" class="rox-docpic" style="height: 140px;" src="help/res/csv-list-export-ribbon.png"
		title="" /></p>
<p>
	Clicking the menu item will let users download the SharePoint List data as a CSV
	file:</p>
<p class="rox-docpic">
	<img alt="" border="0" class="rox-docpic" style="height: 266px;" src="help/res/sharepoint-list-data-export-csv-download.png"
		title="" /></p>
<p>
	In addition to making CSV exports available interactively to end users as illustrated
	above, you can also utilize the same ExportZen capabilities for <a href="?doc=scheduling_sharepoint_list_data_csv_exports">
		scheduled automation of server-side, unsupervised, background List data exports</a>.</p>
<h3>
	Defining Your Export Action</h3>
<p>
	To make the above work, you need to tell ExportZen just a few preferences, by specifying
	for a given export use case (which can then be re-invoked time and again) some so-called
	<a href="?doc=itemref_ExportActions">Export Action Definition Settings</a>, such
	as:</p>
<ul>
	<li>the title of the Export menu item,</li>
	<li>the description of the Export menu item (optional),</li>
	<li>the Columns to be included in the exported CSV data file and</li>
	<li>the types of Lists (or the name of the List) compatible with this export and <a
		href="?doc=itemref_ExportActions">various other settings</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>
	To do so, you just need to create at least one rule on the <i>Export Actions</i>
	page available via Site Settings / ExportZen Studio / Export Actions:
</p>
<p class="rox-docpic">
	<img alt="" border="0" class="rox-docpic" style="height: 388px;" src="help/res/sharepoint-list-data-export-csv-actions.png"
		title="" /></p>
<p>
	On the <i>Export Actions</i> page, simply create and save a new rule item to finally
	define your CSV Export action:</p>
<p class="rox-docpic">
	<img alt="" border="0" class="rox-docpic" style="height: 898px;" src="help/res/sharepoint-list-data-export-csv-definition.png"
		title="" /></p>
<p>
	That&#39;s it! This CSV Export action you just defined is now available in the <i>Actions</i>
	menu of the specified Lists, and clicking it will download a CSV data file with
	only those columns you specified, fully reflecting all of your <a href="?doc=itemref_ExportActions">
		export action definition settings</a>.
</p>
<h3>
	Export menu item not showing up? You can also link to your CSV export:</h3>
<p>
	Your Export action may not show up in the <i>Actions</i> menu of SharePoint 2007
	Document Libraries and other SharePoint 2007 Libraries, and in addition may not
	show up in List <i>Actions</i> menus of heavily customized SharePoint 2007 environments.
	(Such incidents have so far not yet been observed under SharePoint 2013 / 2010 however.)
	To direct users to a CSV export of a given List, simply give them a link to <b>http://your/web/site/url/_layouts/roxority_ExportZen/expo.aspx?exportlist=list_guid&amp;rule=youraction</b>
	&mdash; replacing, of course, the <i>your/web/site/url</i> part with your SharePoint
	Web Site URL, the <i>list_guid</i> URL parameter value with the GUID of the List
	to be exported and the <i>youraction</i> URL parameter value with the name of your
	export action.</p>
