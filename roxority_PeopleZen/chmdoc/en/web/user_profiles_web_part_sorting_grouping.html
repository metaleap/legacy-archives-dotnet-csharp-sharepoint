<h3>
	Sorting<a name="s0"></a></h3>
<p>
	First note that there is <i>always</i> a sort order applied to all PeopleZen team
	listings, the default order of people is <i>never</i> random. The default sort order is
	ascending by user display name. You can customize this by selecting a different user profile 
	field from
	the <b>Sort by:</b> drop-down menu.</p>
<p>
	Numeric fields and date values are not sorted alphabetically, but 
	rather numerically
	or chronologically.</p>
<p>
	In <i>List View</i>, you can 
	optionally allow end users to change the sort field and direction
	(ascending or descending) interactively on-the-fly (re-sorting via column 
	headers) &mdash; inside the <a href="user_profiles_web_part_display_style_properties">
		Display Style</a> section rather than the <i>Paging</i> section.</p>
<h3>
	Grouping<a name="s1"></a></h3>
<p>
	By default, user profiles are not grouped, but you can group them by any user profile
	field by selecting it from the <b>Group by:</b> drop-down menu. For example,
	grouping by the <i>Department</i> field may first show all user profiles belonging to
	the <i>Engineering</i> department, then all belonging to the <i>Finance</i> department,
	then the <i>HR</i> department, <i>IT</i> and so on, all under a respective grouping
	header in each case.</p>
<p>
	The order of the group headers is ascending by default but can be changed to descending.
	This uses the grouping field&#39;s value by default, unless you tick the <b>...but by counts instead
		of group values</b> check-box option. To show the number of profiles belonging
	to each group in parentheses right after the group header, tick the <b>Show counts in
		group headers</b> check-box option.</p>
<p>
	You can allow end users to change the group sort field and direction (ascending or
	descending) interactively on-the-fly, by ticking the <b>Allow interactive ad-hoc change
		of the grouping property selected above</b> and/or <b>Allow interactive ad-hoc change
			of grouping direction (ascending / descending)</b> check-box options.
</p>
