<p>
	The user profiles listed in your PeopleZen Web Parts are provided by a something
	called a <i>Data Source</i>. A PeopleZen <i>Data Source</i> defines the source of
	the information to be displayed, and how to connect to that source (among other
	settings).</p>
<p>
	After installation, there is only one pre-defined PeopleZen Data Source available,
	titled <b>(Default Data Source)</b>. You can customize it or add additional <i>Data
		Sources</i> via Site Settings / PeopleZen Studio / Data Sources. Each PeopleZen
	Web Part then lets you select which of your <i>Data Sources</i> to use (in its settings
	tool-pane, via web part menu / Modify Web Part).</p>
<p>
	Before reviewing <a href="itemref_DataSources">its many other settings</a>,
	the primary choice for each <i>Data Source</i> is the <b>Connection provider</b> setting.
	The currently supported choices are:</p>
<h3>
	Farm User Profiles<a name="s0"></a></h3>
<p>
	This is the default choice for PeopleZen installations on SharePoint 2010 Server
	(SPS) and Microsoft Office SharePoint Server (MOSS) 2007 (and is not available 
	on SharePoint 2010 Foundation (SPF) or Windows SharePoint Services (WSS) 3.0).</p>
<p>
	Retrieves the farm-wide shared user profile information (which is often imported
	from Active Directory) stored in the current default <i>User Profiles Service Application</i>
	(SPS 2010) / the current default <i>Shared Service Provider</i> (MOSS 2007).</p>
<h3>
	Site User Accounts (People and Groups)<a name="s1"></a></h3>
<p>
	This is the default choice for PeopleZen installations on SharePoint 2010 Foundation
	(SPF) and Windows SharePoint Services (WSS) 3.0.</p>
<p>
	Retrieves the user profile information (plus optionally groups if desired) stored
	in the current Site Collection&#39;s <i>User Information List</i> (at /_catalogs/users).</p>
<h3>
	Active Directory<a name="s2"></a></h3>
<p>
	Retrieves user profile information stored in any LDAP-compatible directory service,
	such as Domino or Active Directory.</p>
<h3>
	Database<a name="s3"></a></h3>
<p>
	Retrieves user profile information from SQL Server, Oracle or any other database
	accessible via OLEDB, ODBC or ADO.NET.</p>
