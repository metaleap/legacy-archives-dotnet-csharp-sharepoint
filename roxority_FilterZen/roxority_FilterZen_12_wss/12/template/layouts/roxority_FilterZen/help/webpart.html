<h3>1. It&#39;s a Web Part</h3>
<p>
	Filtering data, information, Lists, Libraries and other Web Parts with <b>FilterZen</b> 
	always involves using the <b>FilterZen</b> Filter Web Part. It is the sole mechanism to 
	define filters and connect them to your data.</p>
<p>
	That however does not necessarily imply that you can use <b>FilterZen</b> &quot;only on Web 
	Part Pages&quot;. Technically and strictly speaking, it does &mdash; but more pages in 
	SharePoint are Web Part Pages than you might know. In addition to the Web Part 
	Pages you create yourself from the <i>Create</i> page (or by clicking <i>New</i> in a Document Library 
	with the Web Part Page document template), all of the following types of 
	SharePoint pages are actually Web Part Pages, so you can can customize their 
	appearance and behavior by adding Web Parts to then:</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>All</b> (out-of-the-box <i>and</i> custom) List Views and Document Library Views</li>
	<li>List Forms (<i>New</i>, <i>Edit</i>, <i>Display</i> &mdash; adding Web Parts to those forms cannot be done 
		from the browser, but is possible from <i>SharePoint Designer</i>)</li>
	<li>Home pages in most web site templates</li>
	<li>Search Results pages in Microsoft Office SharePoint Server</li>
	<li>Pages and tabs in Document and Meeting Workspace web sites</li>
	<li>All pages in Blog and Wiki web sites</li>
</ul>
<p>
	In all these places, you can use <b>FilterZen</b> to filter the information displayed.
	After you have <a href="?doc=setup">installed the <b>FilterZen</b> solution package and activated the site collection feature</a>, 
	you can add the <b>FilterZen</b> Filter Web Part to any Web Part Page in the accustomed way. After having
	switched to page Edit Mode from the <i>Site Actions</i> menu and having clicked the <i>Add Web
		Part</i> button in the Web Part Zone of your choice, you will find it in the
	<i>Add Web Parts</i> dialog:</p>
<p class="rox-docpic">
	<img alt="" border="0" class="rox-docpic" style="height: 387px;" src="help/res/wpdialog.png" title="" />
</p>
<p>
	(If the Web Part is not available in the <i>Add Web Parts</i> dialog, 
	(re)activate
	the <b>FilterZen Filter Web Part</b> Feature under <i>Site Collection
		Features</i>, as described in the last section of the <a href="?doc=setup">Solution Installation &amp; Feature Activation</a> chapter.</p>
<p>
	Add a <b>FilterZen</b> Filter Web Part to the Web Part Page that contains the 
	<i>List View</i> or <i>Data View</i> web
	part that you want to filter. (A <i>List View</i> Web Part is automatically created by SharePoint every
	time you add a list or document library to a Web Part zone using the <i>Add Web Parts</i>
	dialog or other page editing tools such as <i>SharePoint Designer</i>.)</p>
<p class="rox-docpic">
	<img alt="" border="0" class="rox-docpic" style="height: 135px;" src="help/res/wp_01.png" title="" />
</p>
<h3>2. Connect the Web Part</h3>
<p>
	The Web Part points out to you that it is not 'connected'. By 'connecting' the Web Part, you tell it which Web Parts
	should receive the filters you will set up shortly. Connect it to to the 
	<i>List View</i> or <i>Data View</i>
	Web Parts on your Web Part Page that you want to filter by using the <i>Edit / Connections</i> Web Part menu:
</p>
<p class="rox-docpic">
	<img alt="" border="0" class="rox-docpic" style="height: 239px;" src="help/res/wp_02.png" title="" />
</p>
<div class="rox-info">
This notification, and 
	other output produced by the <b>FilterZen</b> Filter Web Part is only ever rendered in 
	Edit Mode by default, so that the Filter Web Part is invisible to page visitors 
	(unless you have set up dynamically generated or manually created <a href="?doc=general#s5">interactive 
	filters</a>).</div>
<p>
	After connecting the <b>FilterZen</b> Filter Web Part to at least one other Web Part, 
	its appearance
	changes to display relevant contextual status information and potentially 
	helpful hints about your filters and its connections &mdash; again, only in Edit mode by default, keeping the Filter Web Part invisible to your visitors.</p>
<p class="rox-docpic">
	<img alt="" border="0" class="rox-docpic" style="height: 440px;" src="help/res/wp_04.png" title="" />
</p>
<h3>3. Set up your filter(s)</h3>
<p>
	Once you have the <b>FilterZen</b> Filter Web 
	Part <i>connected</i> to other Web Parts and have set up and enabled at least 
	one filter for it, it will send them <i>filters</i>, each composed of a filter 
	<i>name</i> and a 
	filter <i>value</i>, whenever the Web Part Page is rendered, by 
	determining the filter names and values from the context and logic provided by 
	your individual filters. When 
	connecting to <i>List View</i> or <i>Data View</i> Web Parts, the filter name ultimately 
	corresponds to a Column name.</p>
<p>
	In this walk-through, we will filter a <i>
	Tasks</i> List View to only display tasks assigned to the current user that are 
	due &#39;tomorrow&#39;. To start, choose <i>Modify</i> in the <i>edit</i> Web Part 
	menu. In the Web Part tool pane, in the <i>All Filters</i> section, select the type of 
	filter you want to add to the Filter Web Part &mdash; to implement the filtering requirement outlined 
	above, we will need both a <a href="?doc=date_filters">Date Filter</a> and a <a href="?doc=user_filters">User Filter</a> &mdash; and click the <img align="top" src="/_layouts/images/collapseplus.gif" />
	<i>Add this new filter</i> icon. So start by selecting <i>Date Filter</i> and 
	clicking the &#39;+&#39; icon:</p>
<p class="rox-docpic">
	<img alt="" border="0" class="rox-docpic" style="height: 220px;" src="help/res/wp_03.png" title="" />
</p>
<p>This will bring up the embedded <a href="?doc=date_filters">Date Filter</a> editor right in 
	the Web Part tool pane. Below, we have already set up the filter as this example requires it. 
	This setup will filter the <i>Due Date</i> column (with the internal name <i>DueDate</i>) to 
	only yield values representing &#39;tomorrow&#39;:</p>
<p class="rox-docpic">
	<img alt="" border="0" class="rox-docpic" style="height: 412px;" src="help/res/wp_05.png" title="" />
</p>
<p>By saving the <i>DueDate</i> filter and then applying the Web Part modifications, the connected Web Part 
	will be filtered accordingly already. Repeat the same steps as above, 
	but this time select the <a href="?doc=user_filters">User Filter</a> type before clicking the &#39;+&#39; icon, 
	to create the required user filter. The following set up will filter the
	<i>Assigned To</i> column (with the internal name <i>AssignedTo</i>) by the 
	current user:</p>
<p class="rox-docpic">
	<img alt="" border="0" class="rox-docpic" style="height: 350px;" src="help/res/wp_06.png" title="" />
</p>
<p>The only settings that are relevant to this very example are the <i>Column / filter 
	name</i> setting at the top, and the <i>default filter value</i> setting just below. 
	You may ignore the other <a href="?doc=user_filters">User Filter</a> settings (hidden from the above screenshot) for now, they are explained in the <a href="?doc=user_filters">User Filters</a> chapter.</p>
<p>Once all filters and Web Part modifications have been saved, your connected Web Parts 
	will again be filtered as specified.</p>
