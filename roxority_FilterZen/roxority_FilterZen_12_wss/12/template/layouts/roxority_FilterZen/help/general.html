<p>
	The following settings apply across all filter types.</p>
<h3>
	Column / Filter Name</h3>
<p>
	This name is the name used to identify a filter among other filters in your FilterZen
	Filter Web Part. It is also the filter name sent to connected Web Parts.</p>
<p>
	Different kinds of Web Parts may vary in their requirements for filter names. When
	connected to a <i>List View</i> Web Part (or a <i>Data View</i> Web Part whose data
	source is a SharePoint list or document library), those out-of-the-box, filter-receiving
	SharePoint Web Parts <i>require</i> the <b>FilterZen</b> Filter Web Part to send
	filter names that correspond <i>exactly</i> to <b>internal</b> Column names (which
	<i>never</i> change once a Column has been created) rather than their current display
	names (<b>Column titles</b>, which <i>can</i> be changed by end-users at any time).</p>
<div class="rox-info" style="background-image: url('/_layouts/images/hhelp.gif');">
	The <i>internal name</i> of a Column is set when a it is first created, and it never
	changes, even though the <i>Column title</i> might be changed repeatedly from SharePoint&#39;s
	<i>Edit Column</i> page later on. The patterns for internal names vary: for some
	built-in Columns from SharePoint&#39;s out-of-the-box List definitions there are
	internal names such as <i>AssignedTo</i> for the <i>Tasks</i> List&#39;s &quot;Assigned
	To&quot; Column, or <i>_ModerationComments</i> for any List&#39;s &quot;Approver
	Comments&quot; Column. A user-created Column with an initial title of &quot;Test-Link&quot;
	will get an internal name of <i>Test_x002d_Link</i>.</div>
<p>
	<b>FilterZen</b> cannot change this requirement (to send filter names corresponding
	<i>exactly</i> to internal Colum names) &mdash; it was built right into SharePoint.
	You therefore need to specify filter names corresponding to the internal Column
	names.</p>
<p>
	To make this as easy as possible for you, we built a useful tool right into the
	Web Part&#39;s configuration tool pane that empowers you to instantly figure out
	the proper filter name to use for the Column you want to filter, that is, its <i>internal
		Column name</i>. Once you expand this tool by clicking the <i>Filtering List Data</i>
	link, you can immediately select the list you are filtering to see all its Columns.
	Now select the Column and you will see its internal name. Just copy and paste it
	into the <i>Column / filter name</i> text box, or click the <i>Use as filter name</i>
	link:</p>

</p>
<p>
	If you are filtering a <i>Data View</i> Web Part sourcing its data from a list in
	<i>another</i> web site or site collection, just enter the web site&#39;s URL in
	the tool&#39;s text box and click <i>OK</i> to be able to locate the list in the
	drop-down box.</p>
<h3>
	Enabling and Disabling Filters</h3>
<p>
	The <b>FilterZen</b> Filter Web Part only ever sends those of your filters that
	are marked <i>enabled</i>. Tick or untick the <i>This filter is enabled</i> check
	box to enable or disable a filter. You need to enter a <a href="#s0">filter name</a>
	before you can enable a filter, because a filter name is required to send a filter
	to conencted Web Parts.</p>
<h3>
	Default Filter Value</h3>
<p>
	All filter types that optionally support an <a href="#s5">interactive mode</a> (i.e.
	all filter types except <a href="?doc=page_field_filters">Page Column Filter</a> and <a href="?doc=url_query_string_filters">Page Request / URL Filter</a>)
	also have a setting to set a default filter value, even though they vary in their
	semantics and user interface depending on the filter type. The default filter value
	is the filter value initially sent, and in <a href="#s5">interactive mode</a>, also
	the one initially presented to end users, which they may then change.</p>
<h3>
	About "Empty" Filter Values</h3>
<p>
	For each filter you create, you need to decide which approach to dealing with empty
	filter values is optimal given the particular filtering context:</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>Empty = Empty or None</i> &mdash; if you <b>do</b> send empty filter values,
		and a filter value is empty, the resulting behaviour of the filter receiver should
		be to show only items where the specified Column has no value.</li>
	<li><i>Empty = All (no filtering)</i> &mdash; if you <b>do not</b> send empty filter
		values, and a filter value is empty, the filter will not be sent, usually resulting
		in no filtering being applied to the specified Column and thus showing all items
		as far as that Column is concerned.</li>
</ul>
<p>
	Every filter type provides the <i>Send filter value even if empty</i> check box
	to control this setting.</p>
<h3>
	Fallback Filter Value</h3>
<p>
	All filter types, including the non-<a href="#s5">interactive</a> ones, let you
	specify an optional <i>fallback filter value</i> that will only ever be sent if
	the filter value is <a href="#s3">empty</a>.</p>
<h3>
	&quot;Interactive&quot; Filters</h3>
<p>
	All filters except <a href="?doc=page_field_filters">Page Column Filters</a> and <a href="?doc=url_query_string_filters">Page Request / URL Filters</a> offer
	an optional interactive mode that you can turn on or off via the <i>Allow users to enter/pick
		a filter value</i> check box. In interactive mode, the <b>FilterZen</b> Filter
	Web Part will render into the Web Part Page a visible, interactive user interface
	control for changing the filter value of each interactive filter. This user interface
	control will be a single-line text box for <a href="?doc=text_filters">Text Filters</a>, a date picker for
	<a href="?doc=date_filters">Date Filters</a>, and a drop-down list for <a href="?doc=choice_filters">Choice Filters</a>,
	<a href="?doc=list_lookup_filters">List Lookup Filters</a>, <a href="?doc=user_filters">User Filters</a>, <a href="?doc=sql_data_lookup_filters">SQL Data Filters</a> and <a href="?doc=bcs_bdc_business_data_catalog_filters">BDC Filters</a>. You can optionally specify a label text in the <i>filter label</i>
	text box, which will then be prepended to the filtering user interface control by
	the <b>FilterZen</b> Filter Web Part, to let your users know what this control is
	actually for. There are also additional Web Part settings for <a href="?doc=advanced#s2">further 
	customizing the appearance and behavior of all interactive filtering user 
	controls</a>.</p>

<h3>Pre-Filtering of Choice, List Lookup, SQL Data, BDC and User Filters</h3>
<p>
	Tick the <i>Pre-filtering &mdash; only offer pickable choices that also exist in a List column</i> check box 
	in a <a href="?doc=choice_filters">Choice Filter</a>, <a href="?doc=list_lookup_filters">List Lookup Filter</a>, <a href="?doc=sql_data_lookup_filters">SQL Data Filter</a>, <a href="?doc=bcs_bdc_business_data_catalog_filters">BDC Filter</a> or <a href="?doc=user_filters">User Filter</a> editor to be able to enter 
	a List View URL and an internal Column name both used to eliminate from the 
	drop-down list of available choices all those that do not exist as exact values 
	in the specified List Column.</p>
<h3>Locking out specific filter values</h3>
<p>In the drop-down list labelled <i>Always suppress certain filter values</i>, select an item other than <i>
	Don&#39;t suppress any filter values</i> to show a multi-line text box allowing 
	you to enter specific filter values. Your drop-down choice then controls whether 
	the filter values entered are the only ones allowed to be sent (<i>Suppress all 
	filter values except...</i>), or the only ones that should never be sent (<i>Suppress 
	no filter values except...</i>).</p>
