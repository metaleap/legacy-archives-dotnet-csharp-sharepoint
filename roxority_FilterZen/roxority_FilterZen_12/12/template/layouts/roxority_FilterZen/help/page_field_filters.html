<p>
	Page column filters only work on Web Part Pages that are stored inside a Document
	Library. Their filter value is always dynamically derived from the value of any
	specified Document Library Column associated with the Web Part Page. The page column filter
	is internally a specialized type of List lookup filter that is pre-configured to
	always use the Document Library containing the current Web Part Page,
	and therefore shares some of the settings and capabilities of List lookup filters.
