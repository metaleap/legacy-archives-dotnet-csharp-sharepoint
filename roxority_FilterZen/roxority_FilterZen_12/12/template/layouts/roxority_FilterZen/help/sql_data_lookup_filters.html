<p>Create a SQL data filter to send filters based on any data stored in 
	ADO.NET-accessible data sources such as relational databases. Whether you let 
	users pick a record set to use in interactive mode, or specify the data row to 
	use directly, the filter value being sent is always the current, live value from 
	the specified data source.</p>
<h3>Data Source Connection</h3>
<p>To connect to your data source, you select the data source provider to use and 
	specify a connection string. If unsure, your database administrator can help you 
	with this. The following ADO.NET data source providers can be used out of the 
	box:</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>SQL Server</b> &mdash; the best option for connecting to any <i>Microsoft SQL Server</i> 
		2000 or higher database (<i>System.Data.SqlClient</i>)</li>
	<li><b>Oracle</b> &mdash; the best option for connecting to any <i>Oracle</i> 8.1 or higher 
		database (<i>System.Data.OracleClient</i>)</li>
	<li><b>ODBC</b> &mdash; the best option for connecting to any database via an <i>Open 
		Database Connectivity</i> driver (<i>System.Data.Odbc</i>)</li>
	<li><b>OLE DB</b> &mdash; the best option for connecting to a <i>Jet</i> database (Microsoft 
		Access) or any other <i>OLEDB</i>-compatible database 
		(<i>System.Data.OleDb</i>)</li>
</ul>
<p>
	Data source providers can be added and removed on the <i>Configuration</i> 
	page in the <i>FilterZen Studio</i> at<br />

<h3>SQL Query, Value Column and Display Column</h3>
<p>
	For the SQL data filter to obtain filter values from your data source, you need to specify, in SQL (or any other query language dialect supported by your data source provider), the query sent to the data source to fetch a result set of filter values. In order for this filter to work as expected, it is mandatory that the result set of filter values 
	is guaranteed by your query to always be returned in a consistent sort order, so 
	in SQL you should add an <i>ORDER BY</i> clause. Per the SQL standard, unless 
	your query specifies the sort order explicitly, the default sort order of data 
	rows is undefined and thus may change randomly at any time.</p>
<p>
	Your query will need to return a stream of record sets (which your query may 
	also pre-filter and sort as preferred) with at least one data column. The name of 
	the column containing the filter value may be identical to the database column 
	or changed to another name by your query &mdash; however, you need to specify 
	the result set column name to be used as the <i>value column</i>, i.e. the name 
	of the column providing the filter value. In interactive mode, if you want to 
	display to the user another column value than the one sent as the filter value, 
	specify the name of the <i>display column</i>.</p>
