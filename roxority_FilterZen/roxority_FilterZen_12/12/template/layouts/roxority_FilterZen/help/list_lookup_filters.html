<p>Create a List lookup filter to send filters based on List data. Whether you let 
	users pick a List item to use in interactive mode, or specify the source item to 
	use directly, the filter value being sent is always the current, live value of a 
	Column you chose.</p>

<h3>View URL of the Lookup List</h3>
<p>Specify the URL of the View used to access the List and retrieve its data. The 
	View provides initial pre-filtering and sorting. A View URL includes the file 
	name of the View page (such as <i>AllItems.aspx</i>).</p>
<p>You can specify a full, absolute URL (those starting with http:// or https:// ). 
	Also supported are site-relative URLs (those starting with / ), to which the 
	site collection root web URL will be prepended at run time, and web-relative 
	URLs (those neither starting with http:// nor https:// nor with / ), to which 
	the current web URL will be prepended at run time.</p>
<h3>Value Column and Display Column</h3>
<p>Specify the internal name of the Column in the lookup List providing the filter 
	value to be sent. Typically this is also the Column you will want to use for 
	displaying filter choices, however, you may also optionally specify another 
	internal name for the display Column.</p>
