<p>Create a user filter to send user filter values. The user filter is internally a 
	specialized type of List lookup filter that is pre-configured to always use the User 
	Information List (at /_catalogs/users) of the current Site Collection, and 
	therefore shares some of the settings and capabilities of List lookup filters.</p>
