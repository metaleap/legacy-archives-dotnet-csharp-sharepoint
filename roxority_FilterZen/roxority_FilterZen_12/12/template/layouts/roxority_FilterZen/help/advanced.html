<h3>
	Suppressing 'Unknown' Filters</h3>
<p>
	This setting is not necessary nor recommended unless you are using a filter that 
	determines filter names to be sent dynamically, rather than using a fixed one 
	you entered for the filter, such as catch-all <i>Page Request / URL Filters</i>.</p>
<p>
	Connected Web Parts may or may not inform the FilterZen Filter Web Part about 
	the names of filterable columns. This information is not always necessarily 
	complete. For example, when you connect to a List View Web Part with three 
	visible List Columns, then it will notify the FilterZen Filter Web Part about 
	these three filterable Columns &mdash; they become &#39;known filter names&#39;. However, you 
	can still validly use any other Column Name present in the List but not the List 
	View, and filtering will still work as expected.</p>
<p>
	If this setting is activated, filter values will never be sent if the 
	corresponding filter name is not in the list of &#39;known&#39; filter names. This 
	setting may work against you because the list of &#39;known&#39; filter names is not 
	always exhaustive. It may be useful, however, to build a single &quot;catch-all&quot; <i>Page Request 
	Filter</i> that takes all URL parameters as filter name-value-pairs, but sends only 
	those that are known, visibly filterable Columns.</p>
<h3>
	Overriding Settings from URL Parameters</h3>
<p>
	By ticking the <i>Override Web Part and filter settings from URL parameters</i> checkbox, every filter setting or Web Part
	setting is overridden by the appropriate URL (query string) parameter value, if it exists. See the possible parameter names and values in the <a href="?doc=ref_url_settings">reference chapter</a>.
</p>
<h3>
	Interactive Filters</h3>
<p>
	All filter types (except <a href="?doc=page_field_filters">Page Column Filters</a> and <a href="?doc=url_query_string_filters">Page Request / URL Filters</a>) support the so-called
	<a href="?doc=general#s5">interactive mode</a> which you enable by ticking the <i>Allow users to enter / 
	pick a value</i> check box. If interactive mode is enabled for at least one of 
	your filters, the <b>FilterZen</b> Filter Web Part renders an interactive 
	filtering user control appropriate for the filter type (date pickers for <a href="?doc=date_filters">Date 
	Filters</a>, drop-down lists for <a href="?doc=choice_filters">Choice Filters</a>, <a href="?doc=user_filters">User Filters</a>, <a href="?doc=list_lookup_filters">List Lookup 
	Filters</a>, <a href="?doc=sql_data_lookup_filters">SQL Data Filters</a> and <a href="?doc=bcs_bdc_business_data_catalog_filters">BDC Filters</a>, and text boxes for <a href="?doc=text_filters">Text Filters</a> into the Web Part Page, allowing your page 
	visitors to change the filtering on-the-fly. The appearance of this Web Part 
	output can be <a href="?doc=ref_css">customized via CSS</a>.</p>
<p>
	If interactive mode is enabled for at least one of your filters, the following 
	additional Web Part settings are available:</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Apply SharePoint toolbar stylings</b> &mdash; if ticked, instead of rendering the 
		filtering user controls with only blank, un-styled <a href="?doc=ref_css">CSS rules</a> applied, applies a 
		set of minimal <a href="?doc=ref_css">CSS stylings</a> resulting in a toolbar-like area.</li>
	<li><b>Remember filter values last used for each user</b> &mdash; if ticked, stores the 
		last filter value used by a user for each filter in the content database. The 
		next time the user visits the Web Part Page, the interactive filtering user 
		controls (and the interactive filters themselves) are pre-initialized with this 
		filter value. Tick this option only if it adds real value (rather than being 
		just a nice-to-have convenience that your users could do without just as well), 
		since it may inflate the content database unduly over time, depending on the 
		number of users.</li>
	<li><b>Upon user input, immediately reload the page to re-filter</b> &mdash; if ticked, 
		causes the Web Part Page to reload itself through a server post-back and apply 
		the newly specified filter values in the process.</li>
</ul>
<p>Interactively input filter values are applied during the next server post-back, 
	whether the above option is active or not, and regardless of how exactly the 
	post-back was initiated. You can force such a server post-back by calling the <i>roxRefreshFilters(filterWebPartID)</i> 
	JavaScript method. Just below the Web Part settings described above, there is 
	also a text area for you to enter additional HTML mark-up code to be rendered 
	into the Web Part area, depending on your choice either prepended or appended to 
	the interactive filtering user controls.</p>

<h3>
	Dynamically Generating Temporary Interactive Filters</h3>
<p>
	Want to offer interactive filtering user controls for all your columns without 
	having to set up all these filters manually?</p>
<p>
	You can have the <b>FilterZen</b> Filter Web Part generate the appropriate 
	interactive filtering user controls for you automatically, on-the-fly during 
	each Web Part rendering for all 
	available &#39;known&#39; filter names. This time-saving feauture generates drop-down filtering 
	lists for choice and lookup Columns (appropriately pre-populated and 
	pre-filtered), date pickers for date Columns and text boxes for all other Columns. 
	To activate dynamically generated temporary interactive filters, from the 
	drop-down list labelled <i>dynamically generated temporary enabled interactive filters for all 
	&#39;known&#39; filter names if possible</i>, select <i>Prepend</i> or <i>Append</i>.</p>
<h3>
	Debug Mode</h3>
<p>
	When a filter does not seem to work as expected, it can be helpful to find out which
	filters exactly the <b>FilterZen</b> Filter Web Part constructs and sends, given its current settings. The <b>FilterZen</b> Filter Web Part will render
	just that information whenever the page is in edit mode, so on the page that does not result
	in the filter you want, select <i>Edit Page</i> from the <i>Site Actions</i> menu
	and you will see all filters produced from the current setup. Also shown are all the filter values that were 
	<i>not</i> sent, if any, and the reason. Unless the <b>FilterZen</b> Filter Web Part is minimized or hidden, its <i>Debug Mode</i> output
	looks like this:</p>
<p class="rox-docpic">
	<img alt="" border="0" class="rox-docpic" style="height: 272px;" src="help/res/adv_03.png"
