<p>The following configuration settings are available to administrative users on the <span id="roxconfiglink"><i>Configuration</i> page in your <i>FilterZen Studio</i>, which you can access via Site Settings / FilterZen Studio / Configuration Settings</span>.</p><p>Each setting has a global value scoped to the SharePoint server farm, and this value can optionally be overridden on the Site Collection level. The following settings are available:</p>
<h3>User Interface Language<a name="s0"></a></h3>
<p>FilterZen has been localized for multiple languages. In addition to English and German, if you have added partial translations in other languages (via Site Settings / FilterZen Studio / DIY User Interface Localization), these languages will be available for selection here. Changing this setting affects all FilterZen user interfaces except captions and descriptions of Features, List Templates, Column Types, Content Types or Web Part Templates (those are always loaded directly by SharePoint based on the current Web Site locale).</p>
<p><strong>You can pick one of the following options</strong> on the <i>Configuration</i> page in the <i>FilterZen Studio</i>:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>(Like site, or English)</i></li>
<li><i>English</i></li>
<li><i>Deutsch</i></li>
<li><i>French</i></li>
</ul>
<h3>Hard limit for pickable choices in drop-down filters<a name="s1"></a></h3>
<p>Interactive drop-down filters (such as Choice, List Lookup, SQL, User and BCS/BDC Filters) use this threshold to limit the number of visibly pickable choices. This is recommended both for usability and performance reasons. To disable the limit (not recommended), set this setting to 0. If you don&#39;t specify a valid integer number, the default value of 150 will be used.</p>
<p>After you have customized this setting, you can click the <b>Reset to Default Value</b> link on the <i>Configuration</i> page in the <i>FilterZen Studio</i> to restore the following default value:</p>
<pre>150</pre>
<h3>How to deal with &#39;Edit in Datasheet&#39;<a name="s2"></a></h3>
<p>Datasheet Views don&#39;t support Web Part Connections and instead of simply ignoring these, unfortunately they usually just fail to display. As a result, when a user clicks &#39;Edit in Datasheet&#39; in your FilterZen-connected List View, an error message is displayed in place of the data. You can resolve this by either ticking the <b>On pages with nothing but a single List View, automatically filter it connectionless</b> check-box option in the <i>Advanced Filtering Settings</i> section of the FilterZen Web Part&#39;s settings tool-pane (SharePoint 2010 only) &mdash; or alternatively, if you manually add a new, separate, dedicated (public) <i>Datasheet View</i> to the List, then FilterZen can automatically redirect your users to this separate Datasheet View page when they select &#39;Edit in Datasheet&#39; in any View.<br/><br/>Select the &#39;Auto-redirect&#39; choice to allow this kind of redirection of users to your dedicated Datasheet View when they click &#39;Edit in Datasheet&#39; on a non-Datasheet View. If you select &#39;Ignore&#39;, then &#39;Edit in Datasheet&#39; on a connected List View page may result in the error message: <i>&quot;There is no valid configuration for these connected parts to run in.&quot;</i> (Note: SharePoint 2010 also lets you disable datasheet views on a per-List basis via List Settings / Advanced Settings.)</p>
<p><strong>You can pick one of the following options</strong> on the <i>Configuration</i> page in the <i>FilterZen Studio</i>:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Ignore problem (displays Microsoft error message)</i></li>
<li><i>Auto-redirect if dedicated separate Datasheet View exists</i></li>
</ul>
<h3>In CAML Direct filtering mode, override List View Web Part folder display only when filters are active (only limited support for this feature in SharePoint 2010)<a name="s3"></a></h3>
<p>The CAML Direct filtering mode allows you to <i>&quot;override the default display of folders&quot;</i> when connected to List View Web Parts. On the <i>Configuration</i> page in the <i>FilterZen Studio</i>, tick this check box to only attempt this override when active filter values have been sent, instead of always.</p>
<h3>Custom image URL for &quot;Loading...&quot; spinner animation<a name="s4"></a></h3>
<p>When filters are applied or cleared, FilterZen by default shows a SharePoint-typical animation (the green spinner) to indicate that an operation is in progress. If desired for design customization or branding purposes, you can enter an alternative picture URL to use for this animation. This can be an absolute or a server-relative URL such as /_layouts/images/roxority_FilterZen/k.gif for example.</p>
<h3>In Text filters&#39; List-based AutoSuggest drop-downs, 1-character entries use BeginsWith instead of Contains<a name="s5"></a></h3>
<p>When connected to List View Web Parts, Text Filters can be set up to offer end users a <b>"List-based AutoSuggest drop-down, if possible"</b>, providing find-as-you-type suggestions for assisted input completion. This drop-down (always limited to the maximum number of entries configured below) invokes an AJAX search against the connected List for the Column targeted by the Text Filter, and returns values containing the current text box input. For huge datasets, it might be more desirable to only match values that start with (rather than contain) the currently typed in letter as long as only a single one has been typed, so that entering B shows all values starting with B. The drawback to this might be end user confusion because the AutoSuggest drop-down will revert to "contains" logic as soon as more letters are typed. (Note: when the Text Filter has its own filter operator set to <i>Begins with</i>, the AutoSuggest will always use begins-with instead of contains logic.) On the <i>Configuration</i> page in the <i>FilterZen Studio</i>, tick this check box to use begins-with rather than contains for single-letter inputs.</p>
<h3>Maximum number of choices in Text filters&#39; List-based AutoSuggest drop-downs<a name="s6"></a></h3>
<p>In an AutoSuggest drop-down, when more than say 20-30 items are displayed, users are much more likely to further refine their text input rather than scan hundreds of choices, and a low limit drastically improves performance of List-based auto-completion drop-downs in Text filters. To customize this, enter an integer number higher than 1, otherwise the default value of 40 will be used as the limit.</p>
<p>After you have customized this setting, you can click the <b>Reset to Default Value</b> link on the <i>Configuration</i> page in the <i>FilterZen Studio</i> to restore the following default value:</p>
<pre>40</pre>
<h3>End-user instructions for Text Filters&#39; List-based AutoSuggest drop-downs<a name="s7"></a></h3>
<p>If desired, use this setting to compose an explanatory note for end users, to be displayed at the bottom of all Text Filters&#39; List-based AutoSuggest drop-downs.</p>
<p>After you have customized this setting, you can click the <b>Reset to Default Value</b> link on the <i>Configuration</i> page in the <i>FilterZen Studio</i> to restore the following default value:</p>
<pre>(Showing max. 40 results)</pre>
<h3>No-Filter Parameter Names (URL / Page Request Filters)<a name="s8"></a></h3>
<p>When using catch-all URL / Page Request  Filters, optionally specify the request parameter names (one per line) that should never be sent as filters. Including the SharePoint-typical URL parameters in this setting&#39;s default value is recommended.</p>
<p>After you have customized this setting, you can click the <b>Reset to Default Value</b> link on the <i>Configuration</i> page in the <i>FilterZen Studio</i> to restore the following default value:</p>
<pre>ContentTypeId<br/>DisplayMode<br/>FolderCTID<br/>InitialTabId<br/>IsDlg<br/>Paged<br/>PageView<br/>PageFirstRow<br/>RootFolder<br/>SortDir<br/>SortField<br/>Source<br/>View<br/>VisibilityContext<br/>p_ID<br/>p_FSObjType<br/>p_FileLeafRef<br/>p_Title<br/>FilterField1<br/>FilterValue1<br/>FilterField2<br/>FilterValue2<br/>FilterField3<br/>FilterValue3<br/>FilterField4<br/>FilterValue4<br/>FilterField5<br/>FilterValue5<br/>FilterField6<br/>FilterValue6</pre>
<h3>ADO.NET Database Connection Providers for SQL Data Access<a name="s9"></a></h3>
<p>Specify the ADO.NET database connection providers that your Database/SQL Data Sources should support (one per line, using the pattern "Provider display name: full provider IDbConnection Type name, full assembly name").</p>
<p>After you have customized this setting, you can click the <b>Reset to Default Value</b> link on the <i>Configuration</i> page in the <i>FilterZen Studio</i> to restore the following default value:</p>
<pre>SQL Server: System.Data.SqlClient.SqlConnection, System.Data<br/>Oracle: System.Data.OracleClient.OracleConnection, System.Data.OracleClient<br/>ODBC: System.Data.Odbc.OdbcConnection, System.Data<br/>OLE DB: System.Data.OleDb.OleDbConnection, System.Data</pre>
<h3>Delimiter for indenting nested pickable List Lookup filter choices<a name="s10"></a></h3>
<p>If you (think you) need this feature, please read or join the <a href="http://roxority.com/filterzen-forum/post/1221588">related support forum thread</a>.</p>
<h3>Never offer the following pages in List View Pickers<a name="s11"></a></h3>
<p>The "List View Picker" filter type lets end users select a different List View to apply to the connected List View Web Part. View pages whose URL paths contain any one of the values specified here (one per line) will NOT be offered for end user selection by this filter type.<br/><br/>combine.aspx refers to the built-in Merge Documents view, repair.aspx to the built-in Relink Documents view, webfldr.aspx to the 2007 Explorer view. These are generally not desirable in a List View Picker context.</p>
<p>After you have customized this setting, you can click the <b>Reset to Default Value</b> link on the <i>Configuration</i> page in the <i>FilterZen Studio</i> to restore the following default value:</p>
<pre>/forms/combine.aspx<br/>/forms/repair.aspx<br/>/forms/webfldr.aspx</pre>
<h3>External Filter Types<a name="s12"></a></h3>
<p>Specify the additional or third-party FilterZen filter types to make available to FilterZen Filter Web Parts in this Farm (one per line, using the pattern "full roxority_FilterZen.FilterBase inheritor class type name, full assembly name"). CAUTION: uninstalling an external filter type assembly will break all Filter Web Parts that still use a filter of that type.</p>
<h3>When remembering filter values, store by name only (and share across FilterZen Web Parts)<a name="s13"></a></h3>
<p>FilterZen Web Parts can be set to <b>&#39;Remember filter values last used for each user&#39;</b>. By default these stored values are unique to the user, the filter name and the FilterZen Web Part storing them. On the <i>Configuration</i> page in the <i>FilterZen Studio</i>, tick this check box to store and restore values only based on the user and filter name instead, which lets you share filter values of the same name between multiple individual FilterZen Web Parts.</p>
<h3>Storage location for &#39;Remembered filter values last used&#39;<a name="s14"></a></h3>
<p>FilterZen Web Parts can be set to <b>&#39;Remember filter values last used for each user&#39;</b>. By default these values are stored both in the user agent (browser) and in the SharePoint content database, but this configuration settings lets you override that default hybrid storage model. Client-side cookies may be cleared by users or blocked due to corporate security policies. Server-side storage may in rare configurations fail silently due to administrative access restrictions even for elevated code, or with large user bases may inflate the content database over time.</p>
<p><strong>You can pick one of the following options</strong> on the <i>Configuration</i> page in the <i>FilterZen Studio</i>:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Both (recommended)</i></li>
<li><i>Server-side content database</i></li>
<li><i>Client-side browser cookies</i></li>
</ul>
<h3>Remove Parameters from URL<a name="s15"></a></h3>
<p>Enter the URL Parameters that FilterZen should remove from the URL when in use (if the Web Part&#39;s <i>Override Web Part settings from URL parameters</i> check-box option is ticked), one per line.</p>
<h3>Enable Web Part Connections menu option &#39;Send single data value to&#39;<a name="s16"></a></h3>
<p>When this option is selected, FilterZen Filter Web Parts will act not only as &#39;filter providers&#39; and &#39;data row providers&#39; but also as &#39;data cell providers&#39;. This is usually not necessary because row providers can always also be used as cell providers and provide a better user experience for the Web Part Page designer. If unsure, <i>don&#39;t</i> select this option.</p>
<h3>By default, no inclusion of jQuery library v1.6.1 (NOT recommended)<a name="s17"></a></h3>
<p>Some FilterZen end user-facing artifacts require (and load into the respective host pages) the jQuery library, version 1.6.1. Embedding jQuery more than once in a single page can cause JavaScript warnings in Internet Explorer with <i>some few</i> jQuery plugins (and only if any are used in your farm at all). On the <i>Configuration</i> page in the <i>FilterZen Studio</i>, tick this check box <i>only</i> if your master pages, web pages or third-party extensions also already include jQuery globally (not just on some individual pages) and independently of FilterZen to prevent FilterZen from loading jQuery too. If you do so, you need to make sure jQuery 1.6.1 or higher is loaded on each page hosting also hosting FilterZen user interface artifacts, or FilterZen will appear broken. This is a global default setting that can be optionally overridden locally where applicable.</p>
