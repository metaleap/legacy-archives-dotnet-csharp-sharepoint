<p>
	Text filters are the simplest of all filter types. In addition to the <a href="?doc=general">
		general filter settings</a> they share with all other filter types, text filters
	let you enter any filter value to send into the text box labelled <i>default filter
		value</i>. Using a text filter, you can filter all column types, including lookup,
	date, user and numeric columns. By enabling <a href="?doc=general#s5">interactive mode</a>,
	you can let your users enter their own filter values in a text box rendered right
	into the <b>FilterZen</b> Filter Web Part.
