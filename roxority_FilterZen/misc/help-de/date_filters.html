<p>Create a date filter to let users enter or pick a date filter value, or to send a 
	filter value that is always based on the current date. You may also optionally 
	specify a number of days to always add to or subtract from the date filter value 
	just before sending it, so as to easily accomplish relative date-filtering concepts such as
	<i>yesterday</i> / <i>tomorrow</i>, <i>one week ago</i> / <i>next week</i> etc.</p>
