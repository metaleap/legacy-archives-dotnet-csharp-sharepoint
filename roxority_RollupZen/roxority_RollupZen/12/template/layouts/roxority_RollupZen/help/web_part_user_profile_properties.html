<h3>
	About SharePoint User Profile Properties</h3>
<p>
	Detailed information belonging to your user profiles in SharePoint is stored in
	so-called <i>User Profile Properties</i>. They contain &quot;people data&quot; such
	as their <i>Birthday</i>, <i>Hire Date</i>, <i>Department</i>, <i>Skills</i>, <i>Past
		Projects</i> etc. SharePoint 2007 ships with over 40 default properties, SharePoint
	2010 with over 60. You can of course create your own additional custom properties.
	You can allow or require your users to manually populate their properties on their
	own profile page directly in SharePoint, and/or you can automatically populate properties
	during your <i>User Profile Imports</i> from LDAP-compatible directory services
	such as <i>Active Directory</i>.</p>
<p>
	It is crucial to note that PeopleZen <i>only displays</i> user profiles and properties
	<i>already stored</i> inside your SharePoint environment &mdash; how they get there,
	how and where they are stored, how they are updated all depends on your SharePoint
	configuration and is outside the scope of PeopleZen.</p>
<p>
	To set up or review your user profile properties and your user profile imports from
	AD or another directory service:</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>in Microsoft Office SharePoint Server (MOSS) 2007:</b> go to Central Administration
		and underneath the <i>Shared Services Administration</i> link in the quick launch,
		click your default Shared Service Provider (SSP), often called <i>SharedServices1</i>.
		On its <i>Home</i> page, underneath the <i>User Profiles and My Sites</i> section,
		click <i>User profiles and properties</i>.</li>
	<li><b>in SharePoint Server (SPS) 2010:</b> go to Central Administration / Application
		Management / Manage Service Applications. If there already is a <i>User Profile Service
			Application</i> listed, click through to it; otherwise, add one via the <i>New</i>
		or <i>Connect</i> menus in the <i>Service Applications</i> ribbon tab.</li>
	<li>In <i>Windows SharePoint Services (WSS) 3.0</i> and <i>SharePoint Foundation (SPF)
		2010</i>, you can add custom user properties via the <i>List Settings</i> page of
		the <i>User Information List</i> in a Web Site, accessible via the <i>Settings</i>
		menu on the <i>People and Groups</i> page.</li>
</ul>
<h3>
	Displaying User Profile Properties in PeopleZen</h3>
<p>
	In the <i>User Profile Properties</i> section pictured above, simply enter the properties
	to be shown in the multi-line text area, <i>one per line</i>. <b>Always include in each
		line a colon [ : ] delimiter, otherwise the property will remain hidden</b>
	from the listings (but can still be selected for interactive end-user ad-hoc <a href="?doc=user_profiles_web_part_sorting_grouping">
		re-grouping</a> or <a href="?doc=user_profiles_web_part_filtering_tabbing_search">re-tabbing</a>).</p>
<p>
	The easier and least error-prone way for adding user profile properties to this
	text box is to select them from the drop-down menu just below it, labeled <b>Add known
		user profile property</b>.</p>
<p>
	Each user profile property contained in this text box is represented by a line containing
	a colon [ : ] delimiter. Before the colon, the internal property name is given,
	for example <i>SPS-Birthday</i>. After the colon, specify the desired localized
	display name shown to end users, for example <i>Birthday</i>. The part after the
	colon can be anything you wish, the part before the colon must be the valid internal
	name of an existing SharePoint user profile property (otherwise you'll see a <i>Property
		Not Defined: [WrongPropName]. An administrator must create this property in the
		Profile Administration tool</i> message).</p>
<p>
	If you do not specify a colon delimiter and a display name, the user profile property
	will not be shown in your people listings. <b>To show the property values but <i>no</i>
		property name,</b> use the special display name ___ (three underscores).</p>
<h3>
	How user names and profile pictures are displayed (or hidden)</h3>
<p>
	User names and profile pictures are also stored in User Profile Properties, but
	PeopleZen shows them already by default without having to specify them in the <i>User
		Profile Properties</i> text box described above. PeopleZen treats these as &quot;special
	properties&quot; and you can customize them in the <a href="?doc=user_profiles_web_part_misc">
		Miscellaneous</a> section.</p>
<ul>
	<li>The pictures are displayed directly rather than showing their textual URL path that
		is stored inside the corresponding <i>PictureURL</i> user profile property. They
		also link to the user profile page (unless this has been customized in the <i>Miscellaneous</i>
		section).</li>
	<li>The user name displayed depends on which user profile properties have been populated.
		If the <i>FirstName</i> and <i>LastName</i> properties are filled out, those two
		values are shown, otherwise the <i>PreferredName</i>, <i>AccountName</i> and then
		<i>UserName</i> property are being probed in that order. The name also links to
		the user profile page (unless this has been customized in the <i>Miscellaneous</i>
		section).</li>
</ul>
