<h3>
	Global User Name Filter</h3>
<p>
	There are certain user accounts that you probably never want PeopleZen to show under
	<i>any</i> circumstances. You can filter these out &quot;globally&quot;, ie. on
	the farm level or on the Site Collection level. This is done via the <a href="?doc=farm_site_config#s9">
		Exclude User Names</a> configuration setting available via Site Settings / PeopleZen
	Studio / Configuration Settings, where you specify fully qualified domain account
	names to exclude, or describe a range of user names with *wild-card* patterns.</p>
<h3>
	Simple Built-In Filtering</h3>
<p>
	Select <i>Edit Web Part</i> from the PeopleZen Web Part menu and in the settings
	tool-pane, you will find the <i>Filtering</i> section:
</p>
<p class="rox-docpic">
	<img alt="" border="0" class="rox-docpic" style="height: 318px;" src="help/res/sharepoint_user_profiles_web_part_filtering_tabbing_search.png"
		title="" /></p>
<p>
	A simple way to let end-users quickly filter by a given primary user profile property
	is the built in <i>Quick-Filter Tabs</i> feature. Simply select that property in
	the drop-down menu labeled <b>Show tabs to quickly filter by</b>. If you select
	the <i>Department</i> property, for example, PeopleZen provides tabs that correspond
	to the existing data values, and each tab shows only user profiles matching the
	implied filter:</p>
<p class="rox-docpic">
	<img alt="" border="0" class="rox-docpic" style="height: 190px;" src="help/res/sharepoint_user_profiles_web_part_quick_filter_tabs.png"
		title="" /></p>
<p>
	This works well for user profile properties with a limited number of repeatedly
	used values, such as <i>Department</i> (where realistically between 3 and 20 values
	will exist), <i>Skills</i>, <i>Past Projects</i>, <i>Manager</i> etc. However, this
	feature has a neat way of also working well with properties of a potentially vast
	set of values, such as user names (as many values as user profiles will exist),
	phone numbers, birthdays etc. Beyond a certain <a href="?doc=farm_site_config#s10">threshold
		number</a> of unique values (the default is 16), instead of providing each value
	as a separate tab, groups of values are subsumed under alphabetical, numerical or
	chronological index tabs:</p>
<p class="rox-docpic">
	<img alt="" border="0" class="rox-docpic" style="height: 168px;" src="help/res/sharepoint_user_profiles_web_part_alphabetical_index.png"
		title="" /></p>
<p>
	To use quick-filter tabs, you need to pre-define a user profile property to filter
	by, but if you want end-users to change this interactively on-the-fly, simply tick
	the <b>Allow interactive ad-hoc change of that property</b> check-box option.</p>
<p>
	You will notice in the above screenshots that a tab simply labeled &quot;&mdash;&quot;
	may be shown at the end that shows all user profiles where the quick-filter tabs
	user profile property has no values at all. You can hide these people using the
	<a href="?doc=farm_site_config#s11">Always hide the [Empty] quick-filter tab</a>
	configuration setting. You can also choose to show the PeopleZen Web Part initially-unfiltered
	by prepending to your quick-filter tabs a tab (to be selected-by-default) labeled
	<i>(All)</i>, using the <a href="?doc=farm_site_config#s11">Always show the [All] quick-filter
		tab</a> configuration setting.</p>
<p>
	Other options in the <i>Filtering</i> section:</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Ignore year when filtering by date properties</b> &mdash; tick this check-box
		option only when filtering (via quick-filter tabs or Web Part Connections) by a
		user profile property of the type <b>date no year</b>, such as <i>SPS-Birthday</i>.
		This ignores the year both from the property value and the filter value when performing
		the filtering. </li>
	<li><b>Ajax-based live filtering</b> — this check-box option controls how filter values
		sent via a Web Part connection with a FilterZen Filter Web Part (see below) are
		applied:
		<ul>
			<li>if unticked, every time a filter is changed in the FilterZen Web Part, the entire
				page refreshes itself to apply the new filter values to the PeopleZen Web Part.</li>
			<li>if ticked, every time a filter is changed in the FilterZen Web Part, no page-reload
				happens but just the PeopleZen Web Part updates itself autonomously in the background
				to apply the new filter values.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li><b>Show only the current user profile</b> &mdash; self-explanatory.</li>
</ul>
<h3>
	Adding Search and Advanced Filtering via Connections</h3>
<p>
	You can further filter PeopleZen by a variety of methods:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>by providing a filter via a URL parameter or posted form value</li>
	<li>by providing text boxes, date pickers or choice selectors for end users to supply
		a filter</li>
	<li>by letting end users select a document or an item in a Document Library or List
		View and supply a Column value as the filter</li>
</ul>
<p>
	All of these above use-cases, and many more, can be achieved by connecting PeopleZen
	to a filter provider Web Part. Select <i>Edit Web Part</i> from the PeopleZen Web
	Part menu and then from the same menu, in the <i>Connections / Get Filters From</i>
	sub-menu select a filter provider Web Part:</p>
<p class="rox-docpic">
	<img alt="" border="0" class="rox-docpic" style="height: 382px;" src="help/res/sharepoint_user_profiles_web_part_get_filter_values_from.png"
		title="" /></p>
<p>
	Depending on the filter provider Web Part, this may show a <i>Configure Connection</i>
	dialog (that you can also use to remove the connection if needed) where you can
	select the user profile property to filter by:</p>
<p class="rox-docpic">
	<img alt="" border="0" class="rox-docpic" style="height: 370px;" src="help/res/sharepoint_user_profiles_web_part_configure_connection_dialog.png"
		title="" /></p>
<p>
	While PeopleZen supports all filter provider Web Parts built into SharePoint (including
	<i>List Views</i> and the built-in Filter Web Parts including the <i>Choice Filter</i>,
	<i>Current User Filter</i>, <i>Date Filter</i>, <i>Page Field Filter</i>, <i>Query String
		(URL) Filter</i>, <i>SharePoint List Filter</i>, <i>SQL Server Analysis Services Filter</i>
	and <i>Text Filter</i>), we highly recommend using a <a href="http://roxority.com/filterzen/"
		target="_blank">FilterZen Filter Web Part</a>, which:</p>
<ul>
	<li>provides the same filter types (and more!) as SharePoint Server Enterprise Edition
		(yet with much extended capabilities), but works across SharePoint 2010 Foundation
		and Server as well as WSS 3.0 and MOSS 2007,</li>
	<li>allows for combining multiple filters in a single filter provider Web Part, having
		individual filters send multiple values (and end users select them easily), advanced
		comparison operators other than just <i>Equals</i> (such as <i>Contains</i>, <i>Greater/Less
			Than</i> and value-ranges)</li>
	<li>and when displayed to end users, fully integrates visually into the User Profiles
		Web Part, becoming a part of it rather than appearing as a separate Web Part (unless
		this has been disabled via the <a href="?doc=farm_site_config#s13">Embedding of connected
			FilterZen Web Parts</a> configuration setting).</li>
</ul>
<p>
	FilterZen lets you compose the most advanced search interfaces for PeopleZen:</p>
