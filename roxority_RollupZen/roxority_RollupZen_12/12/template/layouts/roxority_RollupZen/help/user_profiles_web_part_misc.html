<p>
	Select <i>Edit Web Part</i> from the PeopleZen Web Part menu and in the settings
	tool-pane, scroll down to the <i>Miscellaneous</i> section:

<p class="rox-docpic">

		title="" /></p>
<p>
	At its top, this section lets you <b>specify a custom height (in pixels) of user profile
		pictures</b>. This setting defaults to 0, which causes the Web Part to fall
	back to the currently applicable CSS rules (by default, ie. unless you have CSS
	customizations in place, 72 pixels in <i>Tiles View</i> or 24 pixels in <i>List View</i>).</p>
<p>
	Right below it you can choose to <b>offer the selected print-friendly view in the Web
		Part menu</b> &mdash; this adds a <i>Print</i> command to the PeopleZen Web
	Part menu. To be able to select a print-friendly view from this drop-down list,
	<a target="_blank" href="http://SharePoint-Tools.net/PrintZen/">PrintZen</a> needs
	to be installed in this SharePoint server farm:</p>

		title="" /></p>
<p>
	Right below it you can choose to <b>offer the selected CSV/Excel export in the Web Part
		menu</b> &mdash; this adds an <i>Export</i> command to the PeopleZen Web Part
	menu. To be able to select an export from this drop-down list, <a target="_blank"
		href="http://SharePoint-Tools.net/ExportZen/">ExportZen</a> needs to be installed
	in this SharePoint server farm.
</p>
<p>
	The <b>Loading Animation</b> is shown to indicate that PeopleZen is currently refreshing
	or reloading information to be displayed via AJAX, ie. without causing the rest
	of the page to reload. This can occur when changing a filter or switching to another
	quick-filter tab, paging forward or back, applying a new sort order, changing the
	grouping property or direction or changing the quick-tab filtering property. You
	can choose between a <i>Progress Bar</i> animation, a <i>Spinner</i> animation or
	select <i>(None)</i> to disable any loader animations.
</p>
<p>
	When rendering both <b>user profile pictures</b> and <b>user names</b>, you can
	customize whether to display them and if so, whether to link them to either the
	<i>public profile</i> or the <i>personal page</i> of the user, or not at all.</p>
<p>
	Tick the <b>indicate online presence</b> check-box option just below if you want
	to show a little marker next to the user name indicating the online/offline status
	of the user in the currently available instant messaging infrastructure context,
	if any (predictably, this will be Office Communications Server / OCS integrated
	with MSN / Windows Live Messenger). Clicking the marker will bring up an Office
	Communications menu (2007 products) or info popup (2010 products) for further details
	about, or interaction with this person:

<p>
	Tick the <b>Override Web Part settings from URL parameters</b> check-box option
	if you intend to supply via URL Parameters any of <a href="?doc=ref_url_settings">PeopleZen&#39;s
		URL-overridable Web Part properties</a>.
</p>
<p>
	For improved performance, PeopleZen <a href="?doc=farm_site_config#s14">maintains an
		in-memory cache</a> of user profiles that gets refreshed with potential delays.
	To see immediately how a changed user profile property value affects the Web Part,
	tick the <b>Reset PeopleZen caches when I next click OK / Apply below</b> check-box
	option. Caching is only used for the &quot;SPS/MOSS User Profiles Shared Service
	Application&quot; mode, therefore this option does not apply to the &quot;SPF/WSS
	Site Collection Accounts&quot; mode.
