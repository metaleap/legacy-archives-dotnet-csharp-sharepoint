<h1>Print-Friendly SharePoint List Views</h1><p>
	PrintZen gives you print-friendly Views of your Lists, the easy way.</p>
<h3>
	How PrintZen commands and views work for SharePoint Lists<b style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;" name="s0"></b></h3>
<p>
	In <b>SharePoint 2007</b> (WSS 3.0 and MOSS 2007) PrintZen integrates one or more
	Print commands into the <i>Actions</i> menu of SharePoint List Views:
</p>
<p class="rox-docpic">
	<img alt="" border="0" class="rox-docpic" style="height: 350px;" src="help/res/sharepoint-list-data-print-menu-item.png"
		title="" /></p>
<p>
	In <b>SharePoint 2010</b> (Foundation and Server) PrintZen integrates one or more
	print commands into the <i>View Formats</i>
	section of the <i>List</i> ribbon tab:
</p>
<p class="rox-docpic">
	<img alt="" border="0" class="rox-docpic" style="height: 154px;" src="help/res/sharepoint-list-print-view-ribbon.png"
		title="" /></p>
<p>
	In
	both <b>SharePoint 2010 and 2007</b>, PrintZen also integrates one or more <i>
	Print</i> 
	commands into its own sub-menu within the out-of-box SharePoint <i>Site Actions</i> 
	menu:</p>
<p class="rox-docpic">
	<img alt="" border="0" class="rox-docpic" style="height: 900px;" src="help/res/sharepoint-web-part-print-view-site-actions.png"
		title="" /></p>
<p>
	Clicking the menu item will open a print-friendly display of the current List View:</p>
<p class="rox-docpic">
	<img alt="" border="0" class="rox-docpic" style="height: 431px;" src="help/res/sharepoint-list-data-print-popup.png"
		title="" /></p>
<h3>
	Defining your Print View<b style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;" name="s1"></b></h3>
<p>
	To make the above work, you need to tell PrintZen just a few preferences, by specifying
	for a given print use case (which can then be re-invoked time and again) some so-called
	<b style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;" href="itemref_PrintActions.html">Print View Definition Settings</b>, such as:</p>
<ul>
	<li>the title of the Print menu item,</li>
	<li>the description of the Print menu item (optional),</li>
	<li>whether to apply the current paging, sort order, folder selection or filters</li>
	<li>the types of Lists (or the name of the List) compatible with this print view and
		<b style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;" href="itemref_PrintActions.html">various other settings</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>
	To do so, you just need to create at least one rule on the <i>Print Views</i>
	page available via Site Settings / PrintZen Studio / Print Views:
</p>
<p class="rox-docpic">
	<img alt="" border="0" class="rox-docpic" style="height: 430px;" src="help/res/sharepoint-list-data-print-actions.png"
		title="" /></p>
<p>
	On the <i>Print Views</i> page, simply create and save a new rule item to finally
	define your print view:</p>
<p class="rox-docpic">
	<img alt="" border="0" class="rox-docpic" style="height: 818px;" src="help/res/sharepoint-list-data-print-definition.png"
		title="" /></p>
<p>
	That&#39;s it! This print view you just defined is now available in the <i>Actions</i>
	menu of the specified Lists, and clicking it will open a print-friendly view exactly
	to your specifications, fully reflecting all of your <b style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;" href="itemref_PrintActions.html">
		print view definition settings</b>.
</p>
<h3>
	Designing your own custom Print Views<b style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;" name="s2"></b></h3>
<p>
	Depending on your List printing use-cases, you may prefer to add additional content
	elements to your Print Views. This can be achieved easily via the <b style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;" href="itemref_PrintActions.html#s13">
		Web Part Page for Custom Design of Print View</b> option customizable for each
	of your Print Views. By setting this to a Web Part page URL residing anywhere
	inside the same SharePoint server farm environment, you can completely customize
	the Print View as easily as you typically customize any other Web Part page. The
	below screenshot shows a very simple example of what you can implement here:
</p>
<p class="rox-docpic">

<h1 style="page-break-before: always;">Solution Installation</h1><h3>
	1. The PrintZen Setup Package<b style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;" name="s0"></b></h3>
<p>
	The PrintZen setup package (the <b style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;" href="http://roxority.s3.amazonaws.com/roxority_PrintZen.zip">
		roxority_PrintZen.zip</b> file) is a zipped archive containing:</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Deploy.exe</b> &mdash; a graphical user interface (GUI) setup wizard for installing
		and deploying, or retracting and uninstalling PrintZen to and from a SharePoint
		server farm, <b>to be run by a farm administrator user</b> on the &quot;primary&quot;
		SharePoint farm or web front-end server &mdash; in a multi-server farm environment,
		that is the server hosting <i>Central Administration</i>.</li>
	<li><b>docs</b> &mdash; a folder containing this product documentation in Microsoft
		Compiled HTML (CHM) and plain HTML formats.</li>
	<li>Additional supporting files that are <i>required</i> for <b>Deploy.exe</b> to run
		and must neither be modified nor removed.</li>
</ul>
<h3>
	2. Installing the PrintZen Solution Package<b style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;" name="s1"></b></h3>
<p>
	Run <b>Deploy.exe</b> (under user account credentials added to the <i>Farm Administrators</i>
	group in <i>Central Administration</i>, on the &quot;primary&quot; SharePoint farm
	or web front-end server &mdash; in a multi-server farm environment, that is the
	server hosting <i>Central Administration</i>) and when the <i>Welcome</i> screen
	is displayed, click <i>Next</i> to start a series of system checks. To proceed with
	the installation, all system checks need to succeed:</p>
<p class="rox-docpic">
	<img alt="" border="0" class="rox-docpic" style="height: 433px;" src="help/res/setup01.png"
		title="" /></p>
<p>
	Click <i>Next</i> and on the following screen, select the Web Applications to deploy
	PrintZen to. You can also de-select those Site Collections you <i>do not</i> want
	the setup wizard, upon successful deployment, to <i>activate</i> the <b style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;" href="#s2">PrintZen
		Menu Integration</b> feature immediately for you on.</p>
<p class="rox-docpic">
	<img alt="" border="0" class="rox-docpic" style="height: 433px;" src="help/res/setup02.png"
		title="" /></p>
<div class="rox-info">
	<b>Note:</b> even when PrintZen is deployed in a Web Application, before you can
	offer your Print Views to Lists a web site, the <b>PrintZen Menu Integration</b>
	<i>Feature</i> needs to be <i>activated</i> for the parent Site Collection, as described
	in the <i>Feature Activation</i> section below. For now, the setup wizard performs
	these activations for you, depending on your selections.</div>
<p>
	Click <i>Next</i> to start the installation and wait for the deployment jobs and
	Feature activation to complete. This process can take up to a few minutes.</p>
<p class="rox-docpic">
	<img alt="" border="0" class="rox-docpic" style="height: 433px;" src="help/res/setup03.png"
		title="" /></p>
<p>
	After deployment and Feature activation have completed, review the installation
	log:</p>
<p class="rox-docpic">
	<img alt="" border="0" class="rox-docpic" style="height: 433px;" src="help/res/setup04.png"
		title="" /></p>
<p>
	Once you have successfully completed the setup wizard, you can start defining your
	print-friendly List Views (via Site Settings / PrintZen Studio / Print Views)
	immediately, as described in the <b style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;" href="intro.html">Print-Friendly SharePoint List
		Views</b> introductory topic.</p>
<p class="rox-docpic">
	<img alt="" border="0" class="rox-docpic" style="height: 433px;" src="help/res/setup05.png"

<h3>
	3. Activating the Site Collection Feature<b style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;" name="s2"></b></h3>
<p>
	The <b>PrintZen Menu Integration</b> feature is a <i>SharePoint Site Collection-scoped
		Feature</i>, which needs to be &#39;activated&#39; on each Site Collection it
	is to be used in.</p>
<ol>
	<li>Select <i>Site Settings</i> from the <i>Site Actions</i> menu. </li>
	<li>The <i>Site Settings</i> page contains the <i>Site Collection Administration</i>
		section. In this section, click the <i>Site collection features</i> link. If it
		doesn&#39;t exist, click the <i>Go to top level site settings</i> link in the <i>Site
			Collection Administration</i> section instead, and on the root Web <i>Site Settings</i>
		page now showing, click the <i>Site collection Features</i> link inside the <i>Site
			Collection Administration</i> section. </li>
	<li>The <i>Site Collection Features</i> page (<b>not</b> the <i>Site Features</i> page!)
		should contain a row titled <b>PrintZen Menu Integration</b>.
		<ul>
			<li>If it <b>does</b>, click the <i>Activate</i> button to enable your <b style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;" href="itemref_PrintActions.html">
				Print Views</b> inside this Site Collection; or click the <i>Deactivate</i> button
				to disable the PrintZen List toolbar menu items and ribbon menu throughout this
				Site Collection.
				<div class="rox-docpic">
					<img alt="" border="0" class="rox-docpic" style="height: 380px;" src="help/res/setup06.png"
						title="" /></div>
			</li>
			<li>If the row <b>doesn&#39;t</b> exist, the <b>PrintZen</b> solution package was not
				yet deployed to this Web Application. On the <i>System Settings</i> page (<i>Operations</i>
				in SharePoint 2007) in the <i>Central Administration</i>, click <i>Manage Farm Solutions</i>
				(<i>Solution management</i> in SharePoint 2007). On the <i>Solution Management</i>
				page, click <b>roxority_printzen_xyz.wsp</b> (the <i>xyz</i> part will be different
				depending on your SharePoint version) to open the <i>Solution Properties</i> page.
				Click <i>Deploy Solution</i>, then select this Site Collection&#39;s parent web
				application and click <i>OK</i>. (The deployment is delegated to a background job
				scheduled to run either at the date and time specified, or as soon as possible.
				Once started, it may take this job up to a few minutes to finish deployment.)

<h3>Web Part page for Custom Design of Print View<b style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;" name="s21"></b></h3>
<p><b>(Text box)</b></p><p><b>ONLY supported for Print Views using the PrintZen page mode (see <i>Supported Page Modes</i> tab)!</b><br/><br/>By default, the Print View contains nothing but the selected print target(s). To include additional contents, you can create a custom Web Part Page (only the <i>Full Page, Vertical</i> Layout Template is supported) and specify its absolute or relative URL here (for example, <b>/Shared Documents/OurPrintView.aspx</b>). In this case, the print view will attempt to load and include all Web Parts on that page. That page will also need one additional placeholder Web Part of any kind (for example, a Content Editor Web Part, empty or not) with the title set precisely to PRINTZEN_TARGET, to indicate where the print target(s) should be located. This placeholder Web Part will not be included in the print-out, in its place, the print targets will be added instead.<br/><br/>Note: not all Web Parts may display as expected, since the Web Parts will be &quot;temporarily cloned&quot; in a different page context that is not technically a full-fledged Web Part page &mdash; so experiment for yourself. Web Part Connections, for example, are not currently supported.</p>
<h3>Include Web Part page title bar<b style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;" name="s22"></b></h3>
<p><b>(Check box option)</b></p><p>By default, PrintZen does not include the Title Bar Web Part that is almost always included in all custom Web Part pages, but very often not customized. Tick this option if you&#39;d like to include the Title Bar of the above Web Part page in this Print View.</p>
<h3>Show placeholder names with current values<b style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;" name="s23"></b></h3>
<p><b>(Check box option)</b></p><p>Shows in this Print View all placeholders that you can use for Web Part properties throughout the above custom Web Part page. (Not advisable for end-user printing, but temporarily highly useful while designing your custom Web Part page.)
<br/><br/>
Which placeholders are available and their values both greatly depend on the current context of the Web Part being printed. For your general reference, the following placeholders may usually be available, but we advise you to inspect their typical values and availability in your context interactively yourself by ticking this check-box option during the design phase.
<ul>
<li>{$PrintZen_WebPart_Title$} &mdash; the title of the Web Part being printed (all modes)</li>
<li>{$PrintZen_List_Title$} &mdash; the title of the List being printed in List View mode (or the List containing the item properties being printed, in DispForm.aspx mode)</li>
<li>{$PrintZen_Item_Title$} &mdash; the title of the List item whose properties being printed (if in DispForm.aspx mode)</li>
<li>{$PrintZen_View_Title$} &mdash; the title of the View being printed (if in List View mode)</li>
<li>{$PrintZen_Context_Title$} &mdash; the title of the List Item, List and View, or Web Part, depending on mode</li>
<li>{$PrintZen_PrintAction_<i>xyz</i>$} &mdash; instead of <i>xyz</i>, various placeholders containing most settings of this Print View</li>
<li>{$PrintZen_QueryString_a$} &mdash; the ID of this Print View</li>
<li>{$PrintZen_QueryString_l$} &mdash; the ID of the Web Part being printed (in PeopleZen mode) or the ID of the List (in List View and DispForm.aspx modes)</li>
<li>{$PrintZen_QueryString_View$} &mdash; the View ID (in List View mode), item ID (in DispForm.aspx mode) or the source Web Part page URL (in PeopleZen mode)</li>
<li>{$PrintZen_TitleBar_Caption$} &mdash; the caption set for the Title Bar Web Part of the Web Part page specified above.</li>
<li>{$PrintZen_TitleBar_Description$} &mdash; the description set for the Title Bar Web Part of the Web Part page specified above.</li>
<li>{$PrintZen_TitleBar_Title$} &mdash; the title set for the Title Bar Web Part of the Web Part page specified above.</li>
<li>{$PrintZen_TitleBar_Image$} &mdash; the image set for the Title Bar Web Part of the Web Part page specified above.</li>

<h3>Add a &quot;ScriptManager&quot; control to the page (NOT recommended)<b style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;" name="s24"></b></h3>
<p><b>(Check box option)</b></p><p>Under very rare and unlikely circumstances, using certain (non-ROXORITY) 3rd-party Web Parts on your custom design page will result in an error message that a ScriptManager control is required ("The control requires a ScriptManager on the page. The ScriptManager must appear before any controls that need it.").<br/><br/><b>ONLY</b> if you <i>do</i> receive the above error message should you tick this option: because if you tick it when it is not required, this will give your end users <b>another</b> kind of script warning and you&#39;ll want to avoid this.</p>

<h3>This Print Launcher is...<b style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;" name="s1"></b></h3>
<p><b>(Descriptor for a set of SharePoint Web Sites)</b></p><p>Optionally select in which web sites this Print Launcher will be available. By default, it will be available in all web sites and this usually does not need to be changed during your first explorations within this software. Only perform changes if you are familiar with the terminology presented in the above property editor. Should your changes not result in the expected outcome, you can always easily set this back to "all web sites, no exceptions" and then resume experimenting incrementally with your exceptions.</p>
<p>To define the set of Web Sites, first select either <b>Available in all Web Sites</b> or <b>Available in no Web Sites</b>, then click the <b>except...</b> link to describe which web sites to exclude from that selection. You can exclude:

<h1 style="page-break-before: always;">Configuration Settings</h1><p>The following configuration settings are available to administrative users on the <span id="roxconfiglink"><i>Configuration</i> page in your <i>PrintZen Studio</i>, which you can access via Site Settings / PrintZen Studio / Configuration Settings</span>.</p><p>Each setting has a global value scoped to the SharePoint server farm, and this value can optionally be overridden on the Site Collection level. The following settings are available:</p>
<h3>User Interface Language<b style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;" name="s0"></b></h3>
<p>PrintZen has been localized for multiple languages. In addition to English and German, if you have added partial translations in other languages (via Site Settings / PrintZen Studio / DIY User Interface Localization), these languages will be available for selection here. Changing this setting affects all PrintZen user interfaces except captions and descriptions of Features, List Templates, Column Types, Content Types or Web Part Templates (those are always loaded directly by SharePoint based on the current Web Site locale).</p>
<p><strong>You can pick one of the following options</strong> on the <i>Configuration</i> page in the <i>PrintZen Studio</i>:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>(Like site, or English)</i></li>
<li><i>English</i></li>
<li><i>Deutsch</i></li>
<li><i>French</i></li>
</ul>
<h3>Window Options for Pop-Up Print Views<b style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;" name="s1"></b></h3>
<p>For Print Views that have been set to open in a new pop-up window (rather than the current browser tab), you can customize the options for that pop-up window here. Note that the syntax is JavaScript-imposed, consult our support forum or your in-house web developer / script specialist if unsure about the options or the syntax.</p>
<p>After you have customized this setting, you can click the <b>Reset to Default Value</b> link on the <i>Configuration</i> page in the <i>PrintZen Studio</i> to restore the following default value:</p>
<pre>width=760,height=560,menubar=1,resizable=1,scrollbars=1,status=0,toolbar=0,location=0,directories=0</pre>
<h3>No default instances of PrintZen configurables on the Site Collection level (NOT recommended!)<b style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;" name="s2"></b></h3>
<p>Configurables are lists of items for defining and customizing the behaviors of this software (such as Export Actions in ExportZen, Data Sources and Data Field Templates in PeopleZen, Print Views and Print Launchers in PrintZen, Upload Actions in UploadZen). By default, each Site Collection has its own non-removable default instance that can be customized and to which additional instances can be added. In extensive farm setups (1000s of Site Collections), these default instances may be a hindrance and using only custom farm-level instances may be preferable. Tick this option to never provide the default instance on the Site Collection level.</p>
<h3>By default, no inclusion of jQuery library (NOT recommended)<b style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;" name="s3"></b></h3>
<p>Some PrintZen end user-facing artifacts require (and load into the respective host pages) the jQuery library. Embedding jQuery more than once in a single page can cause JavaScript warnings in Internet Explorer with <i>some few</i> jQuery plugins (and only if any are used in your farm at all). On the <i>Configuration</i> page in the <i>PrintZen Studio</i>, tick this check box <i>only</i> if your master pages, web pages or third-party extensions also already include jQuery globally (not just on some individual pages) and independently of PrintZen to prevent PrintZen from loading jQuery too. If you do so, you need to make sure jQuery is loaded on each page hosting also hosting PrintZen user interface artifacts, or PrintZen will appear broken. This is a global default setting that can be optionally overridden locally where applicable.</p>
